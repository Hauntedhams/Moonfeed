# Clean Chart Auto-Load Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed
Clean charts now load **instantly with the banner** instead of only appearing after viewing the advanced chart.

## The Problem
```
Before:
User scrolls to coin → Banner loads ✅ → Chart missing ❌
User clicks "Advanced Chart" → Goes back → Chart appears ✅

After:
User scrolls to coin → Banner loads ✅ → Chart loads ✅ (together!)
```

## The Solution
Updated `handleEnrichmentComplete` in `ModernTokenScroller.jsx` to update **both** the enrichment cache AND the coins array.

## Code Change
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ModernTokenScroller.jsx`

```jsx
// ✅ NEW CODE (lines 117-134)
const handleEnrichmentComplete = useCallback((mintAddress, enrichedData) => {
  console.log(`📦 Storing enrichment data for ${enrichedData.symbol || mintAddress}`);
  
  // Update the enrichedCoins cache
  setEnrichedCoins(prev => new Map(prev).set(mintAddress, enrichedData));
  
  // 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: Also update the coins array so React re-renders
  // This ensures banner AND clean chart load together immediately
  setCoins(prevCoins => prevCoins.map(coin => {
    if (coin.mintAddress === mintAddress) {
      return {
        ...coin,
        ...enrichedData,
        banner: enrichedData.banner || coin.banner
      };
    }
    return coin;
  }));
}, []);
```

## Why This Works
1. **Enrichment Cache** - Fast lookups, prevents duplicate API calls
2. **Coins Array Update** - Triggers React re-render in CoinCard
3. **Banner Preserved** - Falls back to original if enrichment doesn't provide one
4. **Synchronized Display** - Banner and chart appear together

## Testing
✅ Scroll to new coin → Banner and chart load together  
✅ No need to click "Advanced Chart" to see clean chart  
✅ Chart shows accurate live Jupiter price  
✅ Works on all feeds (Trending, New, Custom)  
✅ Works on mobile and desktop

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Ready for production
