# 🎯 PROGRESS BAR SCROLL - QUICK TEST GUIDE

## ✅ What Was Fixed
The graduation progress bar now responds to horizontal swipe/drag/scroll gestures to switch between Clean and Advanced chart tabs.

## 🧪 Quick Test (30 seconds)

### 1. Start the app
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 2. Find a token with graduation progress
Look for tokens with the progress bar in the top nav area (between nav dots and info icon)

### 3. Test these interactions over the PROGRESS BAR:

#### 🖱️ **Mouse Drag (Desktop)**
- Hover over progress bar → See grab cursor ✓
- Click and drag left/right → Chart switches ✓

#### 🎨 **Trackpad Swipe (Mac)**
- Two-finger horizontal swipe on trackpad → Chart switches ✓

#### 📱 **Touch Swipe (Mobile/Tablet)**
- Swipe left/right with finger → Chart switches ✓

### 4. Verify clickable elements still work
- Click nav dots → Chart switches instantly ✓
- Click info icon (ℹ️) → Tooltip opens ✓
- Drag while over info icon → Should drag, not click ✓

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before ❌
- Progress bar showed grab cursor
- But drag/swipe did NOTHING
- Only worked on nav dots or chart graph

### After ✅
- Progress bar fully interactive
- Drag/swipe switches charts smoothly
- Entire top nav area is now draggable

## 🐛 Debug Console (if needed)

Open DevTools Console and look for:
```
🔧 Chart nav refs: { navContainer: div.chart-nav-dots-top, ... }
🖱️ MouseDown fired on: graduation-progress-bar-container
📈 Scrolling chart to: 375 (or similar number)
```

If you see these logs, events are working!

## 📝 Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/CoinCard.css` → Pointer-events fix
- `frontend/src/components/CoinCard.jsx` → Debug logging added

## 🚨 If It Doesn't Work
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify frontend is running on latest code
