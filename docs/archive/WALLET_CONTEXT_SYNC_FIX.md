# üêõ FIXED: Wallet Context Not Syncing with Trigger Modal

## Issue Identified

The wallet is **connected at the browser level** (you can see the address in top-right), but the **TriggerOrderModal is not seeing the connection** in React state.

**Root Cause**: The `WalletContext` was not properly syncing with Phantom's connection events, causing a race condition where the wallet connects but React state isn't updated.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Wallet Connection Detection
**File**: `/frontend/src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
// Only tried to auto-connect on mount
const resp = await window.solana.connect({ onlyIfTrusted: true });
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Check if already connected first
if (window.solana.isConnected && window.solana.publicKey) {
  setWalletAddress(window.solana.publicKey.toString());
  setConnected(true);
  setWalletType('phantom');
  return;
}

// Then try auto-connect
const resp = await window.solana.connect({ onlyIfTrusted: true });
```

### 2. Added Wallet Event Listeners
**File**: `/frontend/src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`

**Added**:
```javascript
// Listen for wallet connection/disconnection events
window.solana.on('connect', handleConnect);
window.solana.on('disconnect', handleDisconnect);

// Cleanup on unmount
return () => {
  window.solana.removeListener('connect', handleConnect);
  window.solana.removeListener('disconnect', handleDisconnect);
};
```

**What This Does**:
- Detects when wallet connects after page load
- Updates React state immediately
- Ensures TriggerOrderModal always has latest wallet state

### 3. Added Debug Logging
**File**: `/frontend/src/components/TriggerOrderModal.jsx`

**Added**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    console.log('üîç TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State:', {
      walletAddress,
      connected,
      hasSignTransaction: !!signTransaction,
      windowWallet: window.solana?.publicKey?.toString(),
      windowConnected: window.solana?.isConnected
    });
  }
}, [isOpen, walletAddress, connected]);
```

**What This Does**:
- Shows wallet state when modal opens
- Helps debug if context is not syncing
- Compare React state vs browser state

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Fresh Page Load
```bash
1. Refresh page (Cmd+R)
2. Connect wallet via button
3. Look for console log: "üîó Phantom connected event: ..."
4. Open trigger modal
5. Look for console log: "üîç TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State"
6. Verify walletAddress is NOT null
7. Button should be active
```

### Test 2: Already Connected
```bash
1. If wallet already connected, refresh page
2. Look for console log: "‚úÖ Phantom already connected: ..."
3. Open trigger modal
4. Button should be active immediately
```

### Test 3: Connect After Page Load
```bash
1. Load page (wallet disconnected)
2. Open trigger modal (button grayed out - expected)
3. Close modal
4. Connect wallet
5. Wait for "üîó Phantom connected event"
6. Open trigger modal again
7. Button should now be active
```

---

## üîç Debug Process

If button is still grayed out:

### Step 1: Open Console
```bash
F12 ‚Üí Console tab
```

### Step 2: Check Connection Logs
Look for these logs:
```
‚úÖ Phantom already connected: 7tUowJGu...
    OR
üîó Phantom connected event: 7tUowJGu...
```

If you DON'T see these, wallet is not connecting properly.

### Step 3: Check Modal State
When you open the trigger modal, look for:
```
üîç TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State: {
  walletAddress: "7tUowJGu...",  ‚Üê Should NOT be null
  connected: true,
  hasSignTransaction: true,
  windowWallet: "7tUowJGu...",
  windowConnected: true
}
```

If `walletAddress` is `null`, the context is not syncing!

### Step 4: Run Full Diagnostic
Copy and paste the script from `WALLET_STATE_DEBUG.md` into console.

---

## üìä Expected Console Output

### On Page Load (Wallet Already Connected)
```
‚úÖ Phantom already connected: 7tUowJGuqFbLs1WxQp9J8vY9V2n2Zr8cKpXz5Gh4Jb8G
```

### On Wallet Connect (After Page Load)
```
üîó Phantom connected event: 7tUowJGuqFbLs1WxQp9J8vY9V2n2Zr8cKpXz5Gh4Jb8G
```

### On Opening Trigger Modal
```
üîç TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State: {
  walletAddress: "7tUowJGuqFbLs1WxQp9J8vY9V2n2Zr8cKpXz5Gh4Jb8G",
  connected: true,
  hasSignTransaction: true,
  windowWallet: "7tUowJGuqFbLs1WxQp9J8vY9V2n2Zr8cKpXz5Gh4Jb8G",
  windowConnected: true
}
```

All values should match!

## üö® If Still Not Working

### Issue: Event Listeners Not Firing
**Symptom**: No "connected event" logs

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Test manually in console:
window.solana.on('connect', (pk) => console.log('TEST EVENT:', pk.toString()));
window.solana.connect();
```

If this doesn't log anything, Phantom's event system may be blocked.

### Issue: React State Stuck
**Symptom**: Browser connected, but React shows null

**Fix 1: Force Re-render**
```bash
1. Disconnect wallet
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. Reconnect wallet
4. Should trigger state update
```

**Fix 2: Hard Reload**
```bash
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

### Issue: Multiple WalletProviders Conflict
**Check**: Are there 2 WalletProviders?

**File**: `main.jsx`
```jsx
<WalletProvider> ‚Üê Solana's official one
```

**File**: `App.jsx`
```jsx
<WalletProvider> ‚Üê Your custom one
```

If both exist, they might conflict. But the custom one should still work if the fixes above are applied.

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. **Console shows connection**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Phantom already connected: 7tUowJGu...
   ```

2. **Modal shows wallet state**:
   ```
   üîç TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State: { walletAddress: "7tUow...", ... }
   ```

3. **Button is active** (not grayed out)

4. **Clicking button shows Phantom popup**

---

## üéØ Next Steps
