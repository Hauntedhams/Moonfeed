# Feed Info Tooltip Feature - Complete ✅

## Overview
Added an informative tooltip to the coin list modal that explains how each feed type (Graduating, New, Trending) sources its coins.

## What Was Added

### 1. **Info Banner Component** (`CoinListModal.jsx`)
- Added `showInfo` state to control tooltip visibility
- Created `getFilterDescription()` function that returns contextual information for each feed type
- Added interactive info banner below the modal header with:
  - Info icon (ℹ️)
  - "How do we get these coins?" text
  - Hover and click functionality to show/hide tooltip

### 2. **Filter Descriptions**
Each feed type now has a clear explanation:

**Graduating Feed:**
> "Pump.fun tokens that are close to graduating to Raydium. These tokens use a bonding curve mechanism - as more SOL is deposited, they progress towards 100% completion and full DEX listing."

**New Feed:**
> "Recently launched tokens with high initial volume and recent creation timestamps. We prioritize tokens that are less than 48 hours old with strong early trading activity."

**Trending Feed:**
> "Tokens with strong metrics including high volume, growing holder count, positive price momentum, and active trading activity. These coins are gaining significant market attention."

### 3. **Styling** (`CoinListModal.css`)
Added comprehensive styles for the info banner:
- `.coin-list-info-banner` - Container with subtle background
- `.info-banner-trigger` - Interactive element with hover effects
- `.info-banner-tooltip` - Tooltip popup with smooth animation
- `.info-tooltip-arrow` - Upward-pointing arrow connecting tooltip to trigger
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices

## User Experience

### Desktop:
1. User hovers over "How do we get these coins?" text
2. Tooltip appears with smooth slide-in animation
3. Tooltip shows detailed explanation for the current feed
4. Tooltip disappears when mouse leaves

### Mobile:
1. User taps "How do we get these coins?" text
2. Tooltip toggles on/off with each tap
3. Optimized font sizes and padding for smaller screens

## Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Blue accent (#4fc3f7) matching app theme
- **Background**: Dark semi-transparent with backdrop blur
- **Animation**: Smooth 200ms slide-in effect
- **Hover Effect**: Subtle lift and brightness increase
- **Arrow**: Connects tooltip to trigger element
