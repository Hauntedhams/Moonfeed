# Clean Chart & Banner Synchronization Fix

## Problem
Clean charts were only appearing **after** the user clicked to view the advanced DexScreener chart and then swiped back. The banner would load immediately, but the clean chart (5-point price history) remained missing until the advanced chart was viewed.

## Root Cause
When on-demand enrichment completed in `CoinCard.jsx`, the enriched data (including `cleanChartData`) was being stored in the `enrichedCoins` Map via the `handleEnrichmentComplete` callback. However, the original `coin` object in the `coins` array **was not updated**, so React's memo optimization in `CoinCard` prevented re-rendering with the new data.

### Flow Before Fix:
1. User scrolls to a coin → CoinCard triggers on-view enrichment
2. Backend enriches coin and returns `cleanChartData` 
3. `handleEnrichmentComplete` stores data in `enrichedCoins` Map
4. ❌ **Coin prop in CoinCard doesn't change** → React memo blocks re-render
5. ❌ **Clean chart doesn't appear** until user clicks advanced chart (which forces a re-render)
6. ✅ Banner appears immediately (because it triggers a separate state update in CoinCard)

## Solution
Modified `handleEnrichmentComplete` in `ModernTokenScroller.jsx` to update **both** the `enrichedCoins` Map **and** the `coins` array when enrichment completes.

### Changes Made

**File:** `frontend/src/components/ModernTokenScroller.jsx`

```jsx
// Before:
const handleEnrichmentComplete = useCallback((mintAddress, enrichedData) => {
  console.log(`📦 Storing enrichment data for ${enrichedData.symbol || mintAddress}`);
  setEnrichedCoins(prev => new Map(prev).set(mintAddress, enrichedData));
}, []);

// After:
const handleEnrichmentComplete = useCallback((mintAddress, enrichedData) => {
  console.log(`📦 Storing enrichment data for ${enrichedData.symbol || mintAddress}`);
  
  // Update the enrichedCoins cache
  setEnrichedCoins(prev => new Map(prev).set(mintAddress, enrichedData));
  
  // 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: Also update the coins array so React re-renders with the enriched data
  // This ensures banner AND clean chart load together immediately
  setCoins(prevCoins => prevCoins.map(coin => {
    if (coin.mintAddress === mintAddress) {
      return {
        ...coin,
        ...enrichedData,
        // Preserve original banner if enriched doesn't have one
        banner: enrichedData.banner || coin.banner
      };
    }
    return coin;
  }));
}, []);
```

## Flow After Fix:
1. User scrolls to a coin → CoinCard triggers on-view enrichment
2. Backend enriches coin and returns `cleanChartData` + `banner`
3. `handleEnrichmentComplete` stores data in `enrichedCoins` Map
4. ✅ **`handleEnrichmentComplete` ALSO updates coins array**
5. ✅ **React detects coin prop change** → CoinCard re-renders
6. ✅ **Banner and clean chart load together instantly!**

## Benefits
- ✅ Clean charts appear immediately when enrichment completes
- ✅ Banner and chart load together synchronously (no visual delay)
- ✅ No need to view advanced chart to trigger clean chart display
- ✅ Consistent UX - all enriched data appears at once
- ✅ Maintains enrichedCoins cache for performance
- ✅ Preserves existing banner if enrichment doesn't provide one

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Clean chart appears immediately after scrolling to a new coin
- [ ] Banner and clean chart load together (synchronized)
- [ ] No need to click "Advanced Chart" to see clean chart
- [ ] Chart shows 5 real data points + interpolation
- [ ] Chart reflects current live Jupiter price
- [ ] Works on both TRENDING and NEW feeds
- [ ] Works on CUSTOM filter feed
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Multiple rapid scrolls don't cause issues
- [ ] Enrichment happens only once per coin (no duplicate requests)

## Previous Fixes
1. **CLEAN_CHART_LIVE_PRICE_FIX.md** - Fixed backend to use live Jupiter price for chart accuracy

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Clean charts and banners now load together instantly on first view
