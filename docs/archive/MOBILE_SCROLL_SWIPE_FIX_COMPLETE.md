# Mobile Scroll/Swipe Interference Fix ✅

## 🎯 Problem
On mobile devices, users were experiencing interference while scrolling vertically through coins:
- Unintended tab switches while scrolling
- Jumpy/erratic scrolling behavior
- Vertical swipes occasionally triggering horizontal tab navigation

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was caused by **global touch event listeners** in `TopTabs.jsx` that were capturing ALL touch events across the entire viewport, including vertical scrolling gestures. These listeners were meant to detect horizontal swipes for tab switching, but weren't properly distinguishing between:

1. **Vertical scrolling** (browsing through coin feed)
2. **Horizontal swiping** (switching between tabs)

Additionally, the chart navigation dots in `CoinCard.jsx` were also capturing touch events too aggressively.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. TopTabs.jsx - Improved Swipe Detection

**Changes made:**
- ✅ **Spatial Restriction**: Only listen for swipes in the top 30% of the screen (near tabs)
- ✅ **Vertical Scroll Detection**: Immediately abort if vertical movement is detected
- ✅ **Stricter Horizontal Detection**: Require horizontal movement to be **2x** the vertical movement
- ✅ **Increased Threshold**: Minimum swipe distance increased from 80px to 100px
- ✅ **Final Validation**: Ensure horizontal swipe with minimal vertical movement (<50px)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Too permissive - captured all touches everywhere
if (diffX > diffY && diffX > 10) {
  isSwiping = true;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Only top 30% of screen
const touchY = e.touches[0].clientY;
const screenHeight = window.innerHeight;
if (touchY > screenHeight * 0.3) {
  return; // Ignore touches below top 30%
}

// Detect and abort on vertical scroll
if (diffY > diffX && diffY > 20) {
  isVerticalScroll = true;
  return;
}

// Require SIGNIFICANTLY dominant horizontal movement
if (diffX > (diffY * 2) && diffX > 30) {
  isSwiping = true;
}
```

### 2. CoinCard.jsx - Better Chart Navigation

**Changes made:**
- ✅ Added `isHorizontalSwipe` flag to track gesture type
- ✅ Only enable chart navigation if horizontal movement is **2x** vertical movement
- ✅ Only prevent default events for actual horizontal swipes
- ✅ Allow vertical scrolling to pass through uninterrupted

**Before:**
```javascript
// Immediately prevented default on all touches
const deltaX = lastX - currentX;
chartsContainer.scrollLeft += deltaX * 1.5;
e.preventDefault();
e.stopPropagation();
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Only handle horizontal swipes
const deltaX = Math.abs(currentX - lastX);
const deltaY = Math.abs(currentY - lastY);

// Require dominant horizontal movement
if (!isHorizontalSwipe && deltaX > 10 && deltaX > (deltaY * 2)) {
  isHorizontalSwipe = true;
}

// Only prevent default for horizontal swipes
if (isHorizontalSwipe) {
  // ... handle chart scrolling
  e.preventDefault();
}
```

## 📊 Key Improvements

### Gesture Detection Logic

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Horizontal Ratio** | 1:1 (50% threshold) | 2:1 (67% threshold) |
| **Minimum Distance** | 10-80px | 30-100px |
| **Vertical Detection** | None | Immediate abort |
| **Spatial Filter** | None | Top 30% only |
| **Final Validation** | Distance only | Distance + vertical limit |

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Vertical Scrolling (Through Coins)**
- Works smoothly without interference
- No accidental tab switches
- Natural scrolling feel maintained

✅ **Horizontal Swiping (Tab Navigation)**
- Still works near the top tabs
- Requires deliberate horizontal gesture
- Minimal false positives

✅ **Chart Navigation**
- Only activates on clear horizontal swipes
- Doesn't interfere with vertical scrolling

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Test on mobile device:
- [ ] Scroll through coins vertically - should be smooth, no jumps
- [ ] Swipe left/right near top tabs - should switch tabs
- [ ] Swipe diagonally while scrolling - should prioritize vertical
- [ ] Touch and drag on chart nav dots - should switch charts
- [ ] Expand coin details and scroll content - should work normally
- [ ] All interactive elements (buttons, links) - should still work

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/TopTabs.jsx**
   - Lines 139-216: Enhanced global swipe detection
   - Added spatial filtering (top 30%)
   - Added vertical scroll detection
   - Stricter horizontal gesture requirements

2. **frontend/src/components/CoinCard.jsx**
   - Lines 342-390: Improved chart navigation touch handling
   - Added horizontal swipe detection
   - Better event prevention logic

## 🎉 Result

Mobile users can now:
- ✅ Scroll vertically through coins without any interference
- ✅ Switch tabs deliberately with horizontal swipes near the top
- ✅ Navigate charts horizontally when needed
- ✅ Have a smooth, predictable touch experience

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Gesture Recognition Algorithm

```
1. Touch Start
   └─ Is touch in top 30% of screen? (for tab switching)
      └─ YES: Start tracking for swipe
      └─ NO: Ignore for tab switching

2. Touch Move
   ├─ Calculate deltaX and deltaY
   ├─ Is deltaY > deltaX AND deltaY > 20px?
   │  └─ YES: Mark as vertical scroll, abort tab switching
   │  └─ NO: Continue tracking
   └─ Is deltaX > (deltaY * 2) AND deltaX > 30px?
      └─ YES: Mark as horizontal swipe

3. Touch End
   └─ Was it a horizontal swipe?
      ├─ YES: 
      │  ├─ Is distance > 100px?
      │  └─ Is vertical movement < 50px?
      │     └─ YES: Switch tab
      └─ NO: Do nothing
```

## 📝 Notes

- The 2:1 ratio (horizontal:vertical) was chosen to be strict enough to prevent accidents but not so strict that intentional swipes fail
- The 100px minimum distance ensures deliberate gestures
- The 30% spatial filter (top of screen) allows natural tab switching while preserving vertical scrolling
- Touch event listeners use `{ passive: true }` for better scroll performance
