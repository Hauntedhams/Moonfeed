# 🔍 WALLET DEBUG - TEST RIGHT NOW

## Current Status
✅ Added super detailed logging to recheckConnection
✅ Added double-check with delay
✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:5174/

---

## Test It Now! 

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Go to http://localhost:5174/
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Clear any old logs (`Cmd+K` or click 🚫)

### Step 2: Verify Phantom is Connected
Paste this in the console:
```javascript
console.log('Phantom Check:', {
  available: !!window.solana?.isPhantom,
  connected: window.solana?.isConnected,
  address: window.solana?.publicKey?.toString()
});
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Phantom Check: {
  available: true,
  connected: true,
  address: "GXa7..." 
}
```

If `connected: false`, you need to connect your wallet first!

### Step 3: Open Trigger Modal
1. Click on any coin's **Trigger** button
2. Watch the console logs carefully

### Step 4: Analyze Console Logs

You should see this sequence:

```
🔄 Modal opened - triggering wallet recheck...
🔄 Rechecking wallet connection...
   Current state before recheck: { walletAddress: 'null', connected: false, ... }
   Checking Phantom...
   window.solana.isConnected: true
   window.solana.publicKey: GXa7...
✅ Phantom IS connected! Setting state...
   Setting walletAddress to: GXa7...
   State update triggered
🔄 Double-checking wallet state after delay...
🔄 Rechecking wallet connection...
   Current state before recheck: { walletAddress: 'GXa7...', connected: true, ... }
   Checking Phantom...
✅ Phantom IS connected! Setting state...
🔍 TriggerOrderModal - Detailed Wallet State: {
  From Context - walletAddress: 'GXa7...',
  From Context - connected: ✅ true,
  From Context - hasSignTransaction: ✅ true,
  From Window - wallet: 'GXa7...',
  From Window - isConnected: ✅ true,
  Button will be: ✅ ENABLED  ← THIS IS WHAT WE WANT!
}
```

---

## What to Look For

### ✅ GOOD - Button Should Work
```
Button will be: ✅ ENABLED
From Context - walletAddress: 'GXa7...'
From Context - connected: ✅ true
```

### ❌ BAD - Button Still Grayed Out
```
Button will be: 🔒 DISABLED
From Context - walletAddress: ❌ NULL
From Context - connected: ❌ false
```

**BUT window shows:**
```
From Window - wallet: 'GXa7...'
From Window - isConnected: ✅ true
```

---

## If Button Still Grayed Out

### Scenario 1: "Phantom not available"
**Console shows:** `❌ Phantom not available`

**Fix:** Make sure Phantom extension is installed and enabled

### Scenario 2: "Phantom not connected"
**Console shows:** 
```
window.solana.isConnected: false
window.solana.publicKey: null
```

**Fix:** Connect your wallet first using the wallet button in the top-right

### Scenario 3: State Not Updating
**Console shows:**
```
✅ Phantom IS connected! Setting state...
   Setting walletAddress to: GXa7...
```
**But TriggerOrderModal still shows:**
```
From Context - walletAddress: ❌ NULL
```

**This means React state isn't propagating. Try:**
1. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R`
2. Clear React cache
3. Check if there are TWO WalletProviders conflicting

---

## Emergency Manual Fix

If the button is still grayed out, paste this in the console to manually check:

```javascript
// Check WalletContext state
const checkContext = () => {
  console.log('=== MANUAL WALLET CHECK ===');
  console.log('Phantom:', {
    available: !!window.solana?.isPhantom,
    connected: window.solana?.isConnected,
    address: window.solana?.publicKey?.toString()
  });
  console.log('Context should have:', {
    walletAddress: window.solana?.publicKey?.toString(),
    connected: true,
    walletType: 'phantom'
  });
};
checkContext();
```

---

## Quick Actions

### 1. Restart Frontend
```bash
# In terminal
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Hard Refresh Browser
`Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

### 3. Reconnect Wallet
1. Open Phantom
2. Disconnect from site
3. Reconnect

## Report Back 📊

Please share these console outputs:

1. **Phantom Check** (from Step 2)
2. **First 20 lines of console** when you open the modal
3. **The "Button will be" line** from the detailed state log

This will tell me exactly what's happening!
