# üö® RESTART REQUIRED - API Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed
The enrichment API wasn't being called correctly because the frontend was using the wrong API configuration. This has been fixed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST RESTART THE FRONTEND

The frontend code has changed and **must be restarted** to pick up the fix.

### Quick Restart:

1. **Go to the terminal running the frontend**
2. **Press Ctrl+C** to stop it
3. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/victor/Desktop/Desktop/moonfeed\ alpha\ copy\ 3/frontend && npm run dev
   ```

## What to Expect After Restart

### In Browser Console:
```
üîÑ Enriching SYMBOL via http://localhost:3001/api/coins/enrich-single
‚úÖ On-view enrichment complete for SYMBOL in 234ms
üìä Enriched coin data: { hasCleanChartData: true, hasRugcheck: true, hasBanner: true }
```

### On Screen:
- ‚úÖ Banner image at top
- ‚úÖ 5-point clean chart below price
- ‚úÖ Rugcheck lock percentage badge

## Changes Made

**File:** `frontend/src/components/CoinCard.jsx`

1. Added import for centralized API config
2. Fixed API URL construction to use `API_CONFIG.COINS_API`
3. Added detailed console logging for debugging
4. Improved error handling

1. **Restart frontend** (see above)
2. **Open browser** ‚Üí http://localhost:5173
3. **Open console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
4. **Scroll through coins**
