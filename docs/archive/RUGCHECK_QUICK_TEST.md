# 🎯 RUGCHECK ON-DEMAND - QUICK TEST GUIDE

## TL;DR - What to Check

### 1. Open Browser
http://localhost:5173

### 2. Scroll to Any Coin
Wait 500ms for enrichment

### 3. Tap "Liquidity" Metric
Tooltip should show:
- ✅ "🔐 SECURITY ANALYSIS (Rugcheck)"
- ✅ Lock status, risk level, score, authorities

### 4. What Success Looks Like
```
🔐 SECURITY ANALYSIS (Rugcheck)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ LIQUIDITY STATUS: LOCKED
   🔒 Locked: 100%
🟢 RISK LEVEL: UNKNOWN
⚡ Rugcheck Score: 101/5000
🔑 TOKEN AUTHORITIES:
   ❌ Freeze Authority: Active
   ❌ Mint Authority: Active
✅ TOP HOLDER: 7.5% of supply
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Verified by Rugcheck API
```

### 5. What Failure Looks Like
```
⏳ Security data not yet verified
   Rugcheck analysis in progress...
```

## Backend Verification (Already Tested ✅)

```bash
# Test script confirms rugcheck is working
./test-rugcheck-enrichment.sh

# Result: ✅ RUGCHECK ON-DEMAND: WORKING!
```

## Console Logs to Look For

### Backend (Terminal)
```
🔐 Rugcheck data applied for TOKEN: {
  rugcheckVerified: true  ← Should be TRUE
}
```

### Frontend (Browser Console)
```
✅ On-view enrichment complete for TOKEN
📊 Enriched coin data: {
  hasRugcheck: true  ← Should be TRUE
}
```

## If It's Not Working

### Check 1: Backend Running?
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Check 2: Frontend Console Errors?
Open dev tools → Console → Look for errors

### Check 3: Enrichment Completing?
Look for: "✅ On-view enrichment complete"

### Check 4: Rugcheck in Response?
Look for: "hasRugcheck: true"

## Files Changed
- `/backend/services/OnDemandEnrichmentService.js` (logging)
- `/frontend/src/components/ModernTokenScroller.jsx` (critical fix)

## The Fix
Added `rugcheckVerified` to coin data merge so tooltip knows to display rugcheck data.

**Before:** Tooltip checked `coin.rugcheckVerified` → undefined → "not yet verified"
**After:** Tooltip checks `coin.rugcheckVerified` → true → shows full security analysis

## Status: ✅ READY TO TEST
Backend confirmed working. Just need to verify in browser!
