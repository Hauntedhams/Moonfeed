# ⚠️ Wallet Tracker - API Endpoint Issue

## Problem Identified

The Solana Tracker API's `/wallet/{owner}` endpoints appear to either:
1. Not be publicly available yet
2. Require different authentication
3. Have a different URL structure than documented
4. Be timing out or rate-limited

## Current Status

**Working**: ✅ `/top-traders/{token}` endpoint (this is working fine)  
**Not Working**: ❌ `/wallet/{owner}` and related wallet endpoints

## Evidence

When testing the wallet endpoints, we get:
- 500 errors or timeouts
- No data returned even with valid wallet addresses
- Different behavior than the working top-traders endpoint

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Top Traders Data (RECOMMENDED - Immediate)

Since we already have wallet addresses from the Top Traders endpoint, we can display the data we already have:

```javascript
// Top trader data already includes:
{
  wallet: "F8..dt",
  total_invested: 5000,  // How much they bought
  realized: 12000,       // How much they sold for
  total: 7000            // Their profit (PnL)
}
```

**Action**: Update WalletModal to show top-trader-specific data instead of full wallet analytics.

### Option 2: Use Solscan API (Alternative)

Solscan has a public API that provides wallet information:
- Balance information
- Transaction history
- Token holdings

**Endpoint**: `https://public-api.solscan.io/account/{address}`

### Option 3: Use Solana RPC (Advanced)

Query Solana blockchain directly for:
- SOL balance
- Token accounts
- Transaction signatures

### Option 4: Wait for Solana Tracker API

Contact Solana Tracker support to:
- Confirm wallet endpoints availability
- Get proper API access/documentation
- Request feature enablement

## Immediate Fix

Since users are clicking wallets expecting to see data, let's update the WalletModal to show:

1. **What we know from Top Traders**:
   - PnL for this specific coin
   - Buy/sell amounts for this coin
   - Wallet address

2. **Link to external sources**:
   - Solscan link (already have)
   - Add: "View full wallet on Solscan" button

3. **Coming Soon message**:
   - "Full wallet analytics coming soon"
   - "Currently showing data for this coin only"

## Implementation Plan

### Quick Fix (5 minutes):

Update `WalletModal.jsx` to handle the case when API returns no data and show available info from Top Traders context.

### Better Solution (30 minutes):

1. Pass trader data from TopTradersList to WalletModal
2. Display that data in a clean format
3. Add external links for more info
4. Remove broken API calls until endpoints are confirmed working

### Best Solution (2 hours):

Integrate Solscan API or Solana RPC to get real wallet data.
