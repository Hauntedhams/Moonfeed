npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Your Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal)

### 4. Test the Feature

2. Look for a coin card (any coin)
3. Find the **"Liquidity"** metric in the header (top section with all the metrics)

## 📊 What to Look For

### In the Console (Backend)
You should see logs like:
```
🚀 Starting parallel enrichment of 8 coins (DexScreener + Rugcheck)...
✅ DexScreener enrichment complete in 10.2s: 8 success, 0 failed
🔍 Starting Rugcheck for 8 coins...
✅ Rugcheck complete: 7/8 verified
✅ Complete enrichment finished in 12.5s
```

### In the Tooltip (Frontend)
The tooltip should show:
```
Liquidity
$XXX,XXX

The amount of money available for trading...

There's $XXX,XXX available in trading pools for TOKEN, 
making it relatively easy to trade large amounts

🔒 Liquidity Security: 95% locked/burned
⚠️ Risk Level: low
✅ Rugcheck Score: 1500
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No rugcheck info appears"
**Solution:**
- Wait 15-20 seconds after coins load
- Rugcheck enrichment happens after DexScreener
- Check backend console for any errors
- Try hovering over different coins (some may not have data yet)

### Issue: "Rugcheck says 'Unlocked'"
**This is normal!**
- Not all coins have locked liquidity
- This is actually useful information for users
- Users can make informed decisions about risk

### Issue: "Backend shows Rugcheck errors"
**This is okay!**
- Some coins may not be on Rugcheck yet
- The system gracefully handles missing data
- Other coins will still work fine

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Normal Flow:
1. **T+0s:** Coins load from Solana Tracker
2. **T+2s:** DexScreener enrichment starts
3. **T+12s:** DexScreener complete, Rugcheck starts
4. **T+15s:** Rugcheck complete
5. **User hovers:** Full tooltip with rugcheck info appears

### ✅ Re-enrichment:
- Every **5 minutes**, the system automatically re-enriches
- Top 20 coins get fresh DexScreener + Rugcheck data
- Tooltip always shows current information

### ✅ New Data:
- When new coins arrive from Solana Tracker
- All flags are cleared
- Fresh enrichment starts from scratch
- Ensures data accuracy
