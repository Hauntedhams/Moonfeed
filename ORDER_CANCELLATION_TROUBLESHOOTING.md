# Order Cancellation Troubleshooting Guide

## "Failed to Decode Transaction" Error - What It Means & How to Fix It

### Problem Description
When clicking "Cancel Order" on a limit order, you see an error message:
```
Failed to decode transaction
```

This means the transaction returned from Jupiter's API couldn't be properly decoded by your wallet for signing.

---

## Why This Happens

### Common Causes

1. **Versioned vs Legacy Transaction Format**
   - Jupiter may return a versioned transaction (v0)
   - Some wallets only support legacy transactions
   - Our app tries both formats automatically

2. **Outdated Transaction**
   - Transaction may have expired blockhash
   - Network state changed since transaction was created
   - Need fresh transaction from Jupiter

3. **Order Already Cancelled/Executed**
   - Order may no longer exist on-chain
   - Trying to cancel an already-processed order
   - UI state not yet updated

4. **Network Issues**
   - RPC connection problem
   - Jupiter API temporarily unavailable
   - Wallet provider connection lost

---

## How Our System Handles It

### Automatic Retry Logic (Already Implemented)

```javascript
// Step 1: Try to decode as versioned transaction (v0)
try {
  transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(transactionBuffer);
  console.log('[Cancel Order] Decoded as versioned transaction');
} catch (versionedError) {
  
  // Step 2: Fallback to legacy transaction format
  try {
    transaction = Transaction.from(transactionBuffer);
    console.log('[Cancel Order] Decoded as legacy transaction');
  } catch (legacyError) {
    
    // Step 3: Show user-friendly error with instructions
    throw new Error('Failed to decode transaction. The order may need to be cancelled directly on Jupiter.ag/limit');
  }
}
```

### Blockhash Update (Implemented)
```javascript
// For versioned transactions, update blockhash to latest
if (isVersioned) {
  const recentBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
  transaction.message.recentBlockhash = recentBlockhash.blockhash;
}
```

## What You Should Do

### Immediate Steps

#### 1. **Check Order Status on Solscan**
- Click the **üìù Create TX** link in the order card
- Verify order exists on-chain
- Check if already cancelled or executed

#### 2. **Refresh the Page**
```
1. Reload Moonfeed app
2. Navigate back to Profile ‚Üí Limit Orders
3. Check if order still appears
4. If order gone = already cancelled/executed
```

#### 3. **Try Again (One More Time)**
```
Sometimes network issues are transient:
- Click "Cancel Order" again
- Approve in wallet when prompted
- Check for success message
```

#### 4. **Use Jupiter Directly (Backup Method)**
If Moonfeed cancellation keeps failing:

```
1. Go to https://limit.jup.ag/
2. Connect your wallet
3. View your active orders
4. Cancel from Jupiter's interface
5. Return to Moonfeed and refresh
```

## Detailed Troubleshooting

### Error: "User rejected the request"
**Cause**: You clicked "Reject" in wallet popup  
**Solution**: Click "Cancel Order" again and approve in wallet

### Error: "Wallet does not support signing"
**Cause**: Wallet doesn't support required transaction type  
**Solution**: 
- Try a different wallet (Phantom, Solflare recommended)
- Use Jupiter.ag directly

### Error: "Order not found"
**Cause**: Order already cancelled/executed or never existed  
**Solution**: 
- Check order in History tab
- Verify on Solscan with Create TX link
- Refresh page to clear stale UI

### Error: "Network request failed"
**Cause**: Connection to Jupiter API or RPC lost  
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Wait 30 seconds and try again
- Try different time if network congested

## Understanding Transaction Signatures

### Why Signatures Matter
Every order action creates an on-chain transaction:
- **Create** ‚Üí When you place order
- **Update** ‚Üí If you modify order (future feature)
- **Cancel** ‚Üí When you manually cancel
- **Execute** ‚Üí When order automatically fills

### How to Use Signatures for Troubleshooting

#### For Active Orders
```
üìù Create TX: 5wK9m...7hP3q ‚Üó
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Click to verify order exists on-chain
   
üîÑ Update TX: 8nL2p...4jM9r ‚Üó  (if modified)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Click to see what changed
```

#### For Historical Orders
```
Transaction History:
Create: 3xB7c...9kF2p ‚Üó
   ‚îî‚îÄ> When order was placed
   
Cancel: 9mK4w...2hL8q ‚Üó
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Proof of cancellation (if cancelled)
   
Execute: 7jP3r...9nM2w ‚Üó
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Proof of execution (if executed)
```

### Verifying on Solscan

1. **Click any transaction link**
2. **Check transaction status**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Success = Transaction completed
   ‚ùå Failed = Transaction reverted
   ‚è≥ Processing = Still confirming
   ```

3. **Read error logs** (if failed):
   - Click "Logs" tab on Solscan
   - Look for error message
   - Common errors:
     - "Order not found" = Already cancelled/executed
     - "Insufficient funds" = Not enough SOL for fees
     - "Blockhash expired" = Transaction too old

## Prevention Tips

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Keep Moonfeed Updated**
   - Refresh page periodically
   - Clear browser cache if issues persist

2. **Monitor Order Status**
   - Check orders regularly
   - Verify create transaction after placing order
   - Don't assume order is active without verification

3. **Use Recommended Wallets**
   - **Phantom** (best support for versioned transactions)
   - **Solflare** (excellent compatibility)
   - **Backpack** (modern, well-maintained)

4. **Check Network Status**
   - During high congestion, cancellations may be slow
   - Wait for full confirmation before trying again
   - Use https://status.solana.com/ to check network

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes

1. **Clicking Cancel Multiple Times**
   - Don't spam cancel button
   - Wait for wallet popup
   - Each attempt costs gas if successful

2. **Ignoring Wallet Prompts**
   - Always read wallet messages
   - Check transaction details before approving
   - Don't approve if details look wrong

3. **Not Verifying on Solscan**
   - Always check create transaction
   - Verify cancellation completed
   - Don't trust UI alone

## Technical Details (For Advanced Users)

### Transaction Format Issue
```javascript
// What happens when you click "Cancel Order"

1. Frontend requests cancel transaction from backend
   POST /api/trigger/cancel-order
   { maker: "YourWallet...", orderId: "3xB7c..." }

2. Backend calls Jupiter API
   POST https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrder
   Returns: { transaction: "base64_encoded_data" }

3. Frontend decodes transaction
   - Try VersionedTransaction.deserialize() first
   - Fallback to Transaction.from() if that fails
   - Update blockhash to latest
   
4. Wallet signs transaction
   - User approves in wallet
   - Wallet returns signed transaction

5. Backend executes on Solana
   POST /api/trigger/execute
   { signedTransaction: "base64..." }
   Returns: { signature: "9mK4w..." }

6. Success! Order cancelled
   - Signature saved to order record
   - UI updates to show in History
   - Solscan link becomes available
```

### Why Decoding Can Fail

**Blockhash Expiration**
```
Solana transactions include a recent blockhash.
Blockhash expires after ~60 seconds.
If Jupiter returns old transaction ‚Üí decode may fail.
Solution: We fetch fresh blockhash and update.
```

**Transaction Version**
```
v0 (versioned) = Modern format, address lookup tables
Legacy = Old format, no lookup tables
Some wallets only support one format.
Solution: We try both formats automatically.
```

**Corrupted Data**
```
Network error during API call
Incomplete base64 string
Invalid transaction structure
Solution: Retry or use Jupiter directly.
```

## Summary

**The "Failed to decode transaction" error is rare but recoverable:**

1. ‚úÖ Our app automatically tries both transaction formats
2. ‚úÖ Updates blockhash to prevent expiration issues
3. ‚úÖ Provides fallback instructions (use Jupiter directly)
4. ‚úÖ All transactions visible on Solscan for verification
5. ‚úÖ Clear error messages guide next steps

**If cancellation fails:**
- Check order on Solscan (may already be cancelled)
- Refresh page and try once more
- Use Jupiter.ag/limit as backup method
- Contact support with transaction signatures

**Transaction signatures provide complete transparency:**
- Every order action has an on-chain proof
- Click any Solscan link to verify independently
- Never trust UI alone - blockchain is source of truth
