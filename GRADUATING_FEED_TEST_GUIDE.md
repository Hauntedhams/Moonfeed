│ Price: $0.xxxxx            │

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "No graduating tokens found"
**Fix**: Wait 2 minutes for Bitquery cache to refresh, then reload

### Issue: Tab not clickable
**Fix**: Check TopTabs.jsx includes 'graduating' in allowed tabs

### Issue: Coins not loading
**Fix**: 
1. Check backend is running on port 3001
2. Verify API endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/coins/graduating`
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Enrichment not working
**Fix**: Same as other feeds - enrichment is on-demand per coin

### Issue: Wrong order (not best to worst)
**Fix**: Check graduatingScore field is being returned from backend
