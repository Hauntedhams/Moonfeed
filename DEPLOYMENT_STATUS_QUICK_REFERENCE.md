## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Commit `8847446` failed to deploy on Render
- Health check timeout at `/api/health`
- Auto-refresh systems blocked server startup

### Solution
- **Commit `96fb0a9`:** Deferred API calls with setTimeout
  - `newFeedAutoRefresher.js`: 10-second delay before first API call
  - `dexscreenerAutoEnricher.js`: 5-second delay for enrichment
- Allowed server to respond to health checks immediately
