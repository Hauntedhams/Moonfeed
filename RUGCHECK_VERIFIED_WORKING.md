### ✅ All Critical Fields Present
- ✅ `rugcheckVerified`: true (enables tooltip display)
- ✅ `liquidityLocked`: true/false
- ✅ `lockPercentage`: 0-100
- ✅ `burnPercentage`: 0-100
- ✅ `riskLevel`: low/medium/high/unknown
- ✅ `rugcheckScore`: 0-5000
- ✅ `freezeAuthority`: true/false
- ✅ `mintAuthority`: true/false
- ✅ `topHolderPercent`: percentage
- ✅ `isHoneypot`: true/false

## Frontend Integration Status

### ✅ CoinCard On-View Enrichment
- When coin becomes visible → triggers enrichment
- Enrichment request sent to `/api/coins/enrich-single`
- Response includes rugcheck data
- `handleEnrichmentComplete` merges rugcheck fields into coin

### ✅ Tooltip Display Logic
```javascript
// In getTooltipContent() for liquidity metric
if (coin.rugcheckVerified) {
  // ✅ Display full security analysis
  rugcheckInfo += '🔐 SECURITY ANALYSIS (Rugcheck)'
  rugcheckInfo += '✅ LIQUIDITY STATUS: LOCKED'
  rugcheckInfo += '🔒 Locked: 100%'
  rugcheckInfo += '🟢 RISK LEVEL: LOW'
  // ... etc
} else {
  // Show "Security data not yet verified"
}
```

## How to Verify in Browser

### 1. Open App
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Scroll to Any Coin
- Wait for enrichment to complete (500ms debounce)
- Look for console logs:
  ```
  ✅ On-view enrichment complete for TOKEN in XXXms
  📊 Enriched coin data: { hasRugcheck: true }
  ```

### 3. Tap/Click Liquidity Metric
- Tooltip should appear
- Should show: "🔐 SECURITY ANALYSIS (Rugcheck)"
- Should include:
  - ✅ Liquidity lock status
  - ✅ Lock/burn percentages
  - ✅ Risk level
  - ✅ Rugcheck score
  - ✅ Token authorities (freeze/mint)
  - ✅ Top holder percentage

### 4. Expected Behavior
✅ **CORRECT**: Full security analysis with all details
❌ **INCORRECT**: "⏳ Security data not yet verified"

## Backend Logs to Monitor

### Successful Rugcheck Enrichment
```
🔐 Rugcheck data applied for BONK: {
  liquidityLocked: true,
  lockPercentage: 100,
  burnPercentage: 0,
  riskLevel: 'unknown',
  rugcheckScore: 101,
  rugcheckVerified: true,      ← KEY INDICATOR
  freezeAuthority: true,
  mintAuthority: true
}
```

### Failed Rugcheck Enrichment (Token Not in DB)
```
⚠️ Rugcheck data not available for TOKEN: API returned 404
```
(rugcheckVerified will be set to false)

## What Was Fixed

### Backend
1. ✅ Enhanced rugcheck logging
2. ✅ Added explicit `rugcheckVerified: false` on failure
3. ✅ Backend was already working correctly!

### Frontend
1. ✅ Added `rugcheckVerified` to coin merge in `handleEnrichmentComplete`
2. ✅ Added `burnPercentage` to coin merge (was missing)
3. ✅ This was the critical fix - rugcheck data wasn't being merged properly

## Technical Root Cause

**Problem:** Frontend was receiving rugcheck data but not merging `rugcheckVerified` field

**Impact:** Tooltip checked `coin.rugcheckVerified` but it was always undefined

**Result:** Even though all rugcheck data existed, tooltip showed "not yet verified"

**Fix:** Add `rugcheckVerified` to the coin data merge in `handleEnrichmentComplete()`

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/services/OnDemandEnrichmentService.js`
   - Enhanced logging (informational only)
   - Added rugcheckVerified: false on failure

2. `/frontend/src/components/ModernTokenScroller.jsx`
   - **Critical Fix:** Added `rugcheckVerified` to coin data merge
   - Added `burnPercentage` to coin data merge

## Test Commands

### Test Backend Enrichment
```bash
./test-rugcheck-enrichment.sh
```

### Test Specific Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/coins/enrich-single \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mintAddress":"YOUR_MINT_ADDRESS","coin":{"symbol":"TOKEN"}}'
```

### Check Backend Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## Verification Checklist

- [✅] Backend returns rugcheckVerified: true
- [✅] Backend returns all rugcheck fields
- [✅] Backend logs show rugcheck processing
- [⏳] Frontend console shows hasRugcheck: true
- [⏳] Frontend tooltip displays security analysis
- [⏳] Tooltip updates immediately after enrichment (no tab switching)

## Next Steps

1. **Open browser** to http://localhost:5173
2. **Open dev tools** console
3. **Scroll to a coin** and wait for enrichment
4. **Check console** for: `hasRugcheck: true`
5. **Tap liquidity metric** to open tooltip
6. **Verify** tooltip shows full security analysis
