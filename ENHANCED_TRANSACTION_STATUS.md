# Enhanced Transaction Status System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The meme coin trading app now features a comprehensive transaction status system that addresses the timeout issue by providing transparent, real-time feedback to users about their transactions.

## Problem Solved
- **30-second timeout confusion**: Users no longer lose track of transactions that take longer than expected
- **Missing transaction details**: Users now get immediate access to Solscan links and transaction signatures
- **Poor user experience**: Replaced basic alerts with a professional transaction status modal

## New Features

### 🎯 Real-Time Transaction Tracking
- **Live Progress Indicator**: Visual progress through 5 stages (Prepare → Sign → Submit → Confirm → Complete)

### 🔗 Immediate Solscan Access
- **Instant Links**: Solscan links appear as soon as transactions are submitted
- **Copy Signatures**: One-click copy for transaction signatures
- **Direct Exploration**: Quick access to token pages and network status

### ⚠️ Smart Timeout Handling

## Technical Features

### Transaction Management
```javascript
// Track multiple transactions per trade
addTransaction(type, signature, status, amount)
updateTransaction(signature, updates)

// Real-time status updates
setTransactionStage('confirming')
```

### Extended Confirmation
```javascript
// 60-second timeout instead of 30
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Confirmation timeout')), 60000)
);

// Graceful handling of timeouts
if (confirmError.message === 'Confirmation timeout') {
  updateTransaction(signature, { status: 'submitted' });
  // Transaction might still succeed
}
```

### Smart Fee Handling
```javascript
// Fee transactions don't block main transaction success
try {
  const feeSignature = await sendFeeTransaction(feeAmount);
  updateTransaction(null, { ...feeTx, signature: feeSignature, status: 'confirmed' });
} catch (feeErr) {
  updateTransaction(null, { ...feeTx, status: 'failed' });
  // Main transaction still succeeds
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Normal Flow (Fast Network)

### Partial Success Flow
1. Main swap transaction succeeds
2. Fee transaction fails (network issues)
3. User sees success for main trade with fee failure note

3. Option to try again or close
4. No confusion about transaction status
