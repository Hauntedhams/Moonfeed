## 🆘 If Deployments Fail

### Vercel Issues
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify environment variables set
3. Check if build command is correct: `npm run build`

### Render Issues
1. Check deploy logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify environment variables:
   - `HELIUS_API_KEY`
   - `BIRDEYE_API_KEY`
   - `PORT=3001`
3. Check if start command is correct: `npm start`

### Common Fixes
```bash
# If builds fail, check Node version
# Ensure both services use Node 18+

# Vercel: Set in dashboard under Settings → General
# Render: Set in render.yaml or dashboard
```
