# üéØ Percentage Quick Select Buttons - Enhanced!

## What Changed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Uses Live Price from Coin Data**
- Automatically pulls `coin.priceUsd` or `coin.price`
- Calculates trigger price in real-time: `currentPrice √ó (1 + percentage/100)`
- Shows detailed price info in console

### 2. **Buy/Sell Context-Aware**
The buttons now explain what they mean based on your action:

**When BUYING:**
- **Negative % (-50%, -25%, -10%)** = **Buy the dip** üîª
  - Example: "-10%" = Buy when price drops 10%
  - Great for: Catching rebounds, dollar-cost averaging
  
- **Positive % (+10%, +25%, +50%, +100%)** = **Buy the pump** üî∫
  - Example: "+25%" = Buy when price increases 25%
  - Great for: Momentum trading, FOMO protection

**When SELLING:**
- **Negative % (-50%, -25%, -10%)** = **Sell before dip** üîª
  - Example: "-10%" = Sell if price drops 10%
  - Great for: Stop-loss, damage control
  
- **Positive % (+10%, +25%, +50%, +100%)** = **Sell the pump** üî∫
  - Example: "+50%" = Sell when price pumps 50%
  - Great for: Take profit, selling highs

### 3. **Visual Color Coding**
- **Green buttons** = Positive % (price going UP) üü¢
- **Red buttons** = Negative % (price going DOWN) üî¥
- Hover effects for clarity

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Checks if current price is available
- Shows warning if no price data
- Guides user to manual entry mode
- Logs detailed info to console
