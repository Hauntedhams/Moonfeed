# Wallet Context Sync Fix 🔧

## Problem
The "Create Limit Order" button was grayed out in the TriggerOrderModal even though the wallet was connected (visible in the top-right corner).

**Root Cause:** The custom `WalletContext` wasn't properly syncing with Phantom's connection state when the wallet was already connected.

---

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. **Enhanced Event Listeners** (`WalletContext.jsx`)
Added `accountChanged` event listener to catch wallet switches:
```javascript
window.solana.on('accountChanged', handleAccountChanged);
```

### 2. **Force Recheck on Modal Open** (`TriggerOrderModal.jsx`)
When the modal opens, it now forces a connection recheck:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen && recheckConnection) {
    recheckConnection();
  }
}, [isOpen, recheckConnection]);
```

### 3. **New `recheckConnection` Method** (`WalletContext.jsx`)
Added a method to manually verify wallet connection state:
```javascript
const recheckConnection = useCallback(async () => {
  if (isPhantomAvailable()) {
    if (window.solana.isConnected && window.solana.publicKey) {
      const address = window.solana.publicKey.toString();
      setWalletAddress(address);
      setConnected(true);
      setWalletType('phantom');
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}, []);
```

## Testing Steps 🧪

1. **Open the App**
   - Make sure Phantom wallet is already connected
   - You should see your wallet address in the top-right corner

2. **Open Trigger Modal**
   - Click on any coin's "Trigger" button
   - Check the browser console for debug logs:
   ```
   🔄 Rechecking wallet connection...
   ✅ Phantom is connected: <address>
   🔍 TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State: { ... }
   ```

3. **Verify Button State**
   - Enter an amount (e.g., 0.1)
   - Enter a trigger price
   - **The "Create Limit Order" button should now be active (not grayed out)**

4. **Create Order**
   - Click "Create Limit Order"
   - Phantom should prompt you to sign the transaction
   - You should see success message

## Debug Console Output 📊

### Before Fix (Grayed Out Button)
```
🔍 TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State: {
  walletAddress: null,           ❌ Wrong!
  connected: false,              ❌ Wrong!
  hasSignTransaction: false,
  windowWallet: "GXa7...",       ✅ Correct
  windowConnected: true          ✅ Correct
}
```

### After Fix (Active Button)
```
🔄 Rechecking wallet connection...
✅ Phantom is connected: GXa7...
🔍 TriggerOrderModal - Wallet State: {
  walletAddress: "GXa7...",      ✅ Correct!
  connected: true,               ✅ Correct!
  hasSignTransaction: true,      ✅ Correct!
  windowWallet: "GXa7...",       ✅ Correct
  windowConnected: true          ✅ Correct
}
```

## Files Modified 📝

1. **`/frontend/src/contexts/WalletContext.jsx`**
   - Added `accountChanged` event listener
   - Added `recheckConnection()` method
   - Exposed `recheckConnection` in context value

2. **`/frontend/src/components/TriggerOrderModal.jsx`**
   - Added `recheckConnection` to `useWallet()` destructuring
   - Added `useEffect` to call `recheckConnection()` when modal opens

---

## Additional Notes 💡

### Why This Happened
The wallet was connecting **before** the custom `WalletContext` was mounted, so the initial connection state wasn't captured. The event listeners would catch future connections, but not the initial one.

### The Fix
By adding `recheckConnection()` and calling it when the modal opens, we force the context to sync with Phantom's actual connection state.

### Alternative Solutions (Not Used)
1. **Use Solana Wallet Adapter exclusively** - Would require refactoring all wallet code
2. **Polling** - Less efficient, more resource-intensive
3. **Window-level state sync** - More complex, harder to maintain

---

## Next Steps 🚀

1. **Test the Fix**
   - Open trigger modal with wallet already connected
   - Button should be active
   - Order creation should work

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Connect wallet **after** opening modal (should auto-update)
   - Switch accounts in Phantom (should detect change)
   - Disconnect and reconnect (should sync properly)

3. **Optional Cleanup**
   - Consider removing Solana Wallet Adapter if only using custom context
   - Or migrate fully to Solana Wallet Adapter for consistency
