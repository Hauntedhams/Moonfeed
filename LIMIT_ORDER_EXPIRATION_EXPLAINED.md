# Jupiter Limit Order Expiration - How It Works üìã

## Your Order Details
- **Amount**: 0.03 SOL
- **Price Target**: Current price + 10%
- **Expiry**: 1 hour
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Order created successfully

## What Happens Now?

### If Price Reaches Your Target WITHIN 1 Hour:
‚úÖ **Order Executes Automatically**
- Jupiter's system monitors the price continuously
- When the token hits your target price (+10%), the order executes instantly
- Your 0.03 SOL gets swapped for the token at your target price
- You receive the tokens in your wallet
- Referral fee (0.7%) is automatically deducted

### If Price Does NOT Reach Target in 1 Hour:
‚ùå **Order Expires and is Cancelled**
- After 1 hour, if the price hasn't hit +10%, the order automatically expires
- **Your 0.03 SOL stays in your wallet** - you don't lose anything!
- The order is removed from Jupiter's system
- No transaction fees are charged (because no swap happened)
- You can create a new order with different parameters if you want

## Order Expiration Options

You had these choices when creating the order:

| Option | Time Window | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **1 hour** | 60 minutes | Quick trades, volatile tokens |
| **24 hours** | 1 day | Day trading, moderate volatility |
| **7 days** | 1 week | ‚≠ê **Default** - Most popular |
| **30 days** | 1 month | Long-term holds, patient trading |

## Why Use Expiration Times?

### 1. **Prevents Stale Orders**
- Crypto prices change rapidly
- A price that made sense yesterday might not today
- Expiration keeps your strategy fresh

### 2. **Frees Up Capital**
- If order doesn't fill, your SOL isn't "locked" forever
- You can use it for other opportunities

### 3. **Market Conditions Change**
- News, events, or trends might make you reconsider
- Expiration gives you a natural exit point to reassess

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Order Fills ‚úÖ
```
Time: 0:00   - You create order: Buy at $0.0011 (+10%)
Time: 0:23   - Price hits $0.0011
Time: 0:23   - Order executes automatically
Result: You own tokens at your target price!
```

### Scenario 2: Order Expires ‚è±Ô∏è
```
Time: 0:00   - You create order: Buy at $0.0011 (+10%)
Time: 0:45   - Price at $0.00095 (not reached target)
Time: 1:00   - Order expires automatically
Result: Your 0.03 SOL stays in wallet, no fees charged
```

### Scenario 3: Manual Cancel üõë
```
Time: 0:00   - You create order: Buy at $0.0011 (+10%)
Time: 0:15   - You change your mind and cancel
Result: Order cancelled, SOL returns immediately
```

## Key Points to Remember

### ‚úÖ What's Safe:
- Your SOL is **always** in your wallet
- No transaction fees if order doesn't fill
- You can cancel anytime before expiration
- Expiration is automatic - no action needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Know:
- Once order fills, **it's final** (like any blockchain transaction)
- Referral fee (0.7%) only charged **if order executes**
- Network fees apply only when order actually executes
- You need enough SOL for both the trade AND network fees

## Managing Your Orders

### View Active Orders:
```javascript
// In the Limit Order tab, you can see:
- Order ID
- Token name
- Target price
- Amount
- Expiration time
- Status (Active/Filled/Expired)
```

### Cancel Before Expiration:
1. Go to Limit Order tab
2. Find your order in "Active Orders"
3. Click "Cancel"
4. Confirm in wallet
5. Order cancelled immediately

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Set realistic price targets (within market range)
- Use shorter expiry for volatile tokens (1h-24h)
- Use longer expiry for stable targets (7d-30d)
- Check your order status periodically
- Keep extra SOL for network fees

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Set prices too far from current market
- Forget about expired orders
- Create multiple duplicate orders
- Use all your SOL (save some for fees)

## Technical Details

### How Jupiter Monitors Your Order:
1. Order stored on-chain (Solana blockchain)
2. Jupiter's trigger system checks price every few seconds
3. When condition met ‚Üí Transaction automatically submitted
4. Your wallet automatically signs (you approved this when creating order)
5. Swap executes via Jupiter's routing

### Why It's Trustless:
- Your funds **never** leave your wallet until swap executes
- Order logic runs on-chain (transparent, verifiable)
- You can cancel anytime
- No counterparty risk

### Transaction Flow:
```
1. Create Order  ‚Üí Wallet signs "future transaction" instructions
2. Price Hits    ‚Üí Jupiter detects condition met
3. Execute       ‚Üí Pre-signed transaction submitted to Solana
4. Complete      ‚Üí Tokens appear in your wallet
```

## Comparison with Traditional Limit Orders

### CEX (Centralized Exchange) Limit Orders:
- Your funds held by exchange
- Fills depend on order book depth
- May partially fill
- Can be cancelled anytime

### Jupiter Limit Orders:
- Your funds stay in your wallet ‚úÖ
- Fills via DEX liquidity (Jupiter routing)
- **All or nothing** execution (no partial fills)
- Can be cancelled anytime before execution

## FAQ

### Q: What if price goes above +10% but I'm not online?
**A:** Order executes automatically! You don't need to be online or watching.

### Q: Can I have multiple limit orders?
**A:** Yes! You can create as many as you want for different tokens/prices.

### Q: What if I don't have enough SOL for fees when order triggers?
**A:** Order will fail and remain active until it succeeds or expires.

### Q: Can I change my order after creating it?
**A:** No - you must cancel the old order and create a new one.

### Q: Do I pay fees if order expires unfilled?
**A:** No! Only creation requires a tiny signature fee (~0.000005 SOL).

### Q: Can Jupiter guarantee my order fills at exactly +10%?
**A:** Yes, if liquidity exists at that price. Jupiter uses multiple DEXs to find best execution.
