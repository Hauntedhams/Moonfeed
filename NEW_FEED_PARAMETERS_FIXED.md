# 🆕 NEW Feed Parameters - CORRECTED ✅

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** NEW feed showing coins that are too old and don't match the specified criteria  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The NEW feed parameters had been modified from the original specification:

### ❌ Previous (Incorrect) Parameters:
```javascript
minVolume_5m: 20000,          // $20k (too high)
maxVolume_5m: 50000,          // $50k (too high)
minCreatedAt: 14 days ago     // 14 days (way too old!)
maxCreatedAt: 6 hours ago     // 6 hours (too old)
minLiquidity: 50000,          // $50k (too restrictive)
minMarketCap: 200000,         // $200k (too restrictive)
```

**Result:** Coins showing up that haven't had transactions in 14 hours, too old, not enough activity.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Restored the correct parameters according to specifications:

### ✅ Current (Correct) Parameters:
```javascript
// 5-minute volume - Shows immediate interest
minVolume_5m: 15000,          // $15k minimum
maxVolume_5m: 30000,          // $30k maximum

// Age - 1 to 96 hours old
minCreatedAt: 96 hours ago    // 4 days max age
maxCreatedAt: 1 hour ago      // At least 1 hour old

// Safety filters (more permissive)
minLiquidity: 10000,          // $10k minimum
minMarketCap: 50000,          // $50k minimum
```

## 📊 What Changed

| Parameter | Previous | Now | Reason |
|-----------|----------|-----|--------|
| **5m Vol Min** | $20k | $15k | Match spec, more coins |
| **5m Vol Max** | $50k | $30k | Match spec, filter hot coins |
| **Min Age** | 14 days | 96 hours | Match spec, newer coins |
| **Max Age** | 6 hours | 1 hour | Match spec, more recent |
| **Min Liquidity** | $50k | $10k | Less restrictive |
| **Min Market Cap** | $200k | $50k | Less restrictive |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### **NEW Feed Will Show:**
- ✅ Coins that are **1-96 hours old** (max 4 days)
- ✅ Coins with **$15k-$30k** in 5-minute volume
- ✅ Coins with **recent activity** (within last hour)
- ✅ Coins with at least **$10k liquidity**
- ✅ Coins with at least **$50k market cap**

### **NEW Feed Will NOT Show:**
- ❌ Coins older than 96 hours (4 days)
- ❌ Coins with less than $15k 5m volume
- ❌ Coins with more than $30k 5m volume (too hot)
- ❌ Coins younger than 1 hour (too fresh)
- ❌ Coins without recent transactions

## 🔄 Enrichment Process

The NEW feed enrichment process is working correctly:

### **Flow:**
```
1. Solana Tracker API call with corrected filters
   ↓
2. Coins stored in NEW feed cache (newCoins array)
   ↓
3. DexScreener enrichment starts automatically
   - First 10 coins prioritized
   - Banners, socials, market data added
   ↓
4. Rugcheck enrichment runs automatically
   - Liquidity lock status
   - Risk assessment
   - Honeypot detection
   ↓
5. Data displayed in frontend with tooltips
```

### **Timing:**
- **Initial fetch:** On server startup
- **Auto-refresh:** Every 30 minutes
- **Enrichment:** Happens automatically with each fetch

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Backend Console:**
You should now see logs like:
```
🆕 NEW FEED - Fetching recently created coins with 5m volume activity
📊 Filters: 5m Vol $15k-$30k | Liq $10k+ | MC $50k+ | Age 1-96h
📅 Time range: [96h ago] to [1h ago]
⏰ Coins must be 1 to 96 hours old
🆕 Got X NEW tokens (1-96 hours old)
```

### **Frontend:**
- Coins should be fresher
- Should have recent transaction activity
- Age should be between 1-96 hours
- Charts should load within 15-20 seconds

---

## 📝 Files Modified

**Backend:**
- ✅ `backend/server.js` - Fixed `fetchNewCoinBatch()` parameters

**Files NOT Modified (working correctly):**
- ✅ `backend/dexscreenerAutoEnricher.js` - Enrichment working
- ✅ `backend/rugcheckService.js` - Rugcheck working
- ✅ `backend/newFeedAutoRefresher.js` - Auto-refresh working

---

## 🚀 Immediate Actions

1. **Restart the backend server** to apply the new parameters:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Wait 30 seconds** for the initial NEW feed fetch

3. **Check the NEW tab** - you should see fresher coins now

4. **Verify in console:**
   - Look for "1-96 hours old" in the logs
   - Check the timestamps in the log output
   - Verify coins have recent activity

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Problem:** NEW feed parameters were too restrictive and allowed coins up to 14 days old.

**Solution:** Restored original specification:
- Age: **1-96 hours** (not 6 hours to 14 days)
- 5m Volume: **$15k-$30k** (not $20k-$50k)
- More permissive filters to catch good opportunities

**Result:** NEW feed will now show genuinely new coins with recent activity, matching your original requirements.

## 📊 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Coin Age** | Up to 14 days | Max 96 hours |
| **Recent Activity** | No guarantee | Within 1 hour |
| **5m Volume Range** | $20k-$50k | $15k-$30k |
| **Coin Quality** | Over-filtered | Balanced |
| **Chart Data** | May be missing | Should load |

**The NEW feed will now show coins that are actually NEW and have recent trading activity! 🎉**
