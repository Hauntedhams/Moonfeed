## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Not seeing graduation %?
✅ Make sure you're on **Graduating** tab (not Trending/New)  
✅ Check that backend is running  
✅ Verify Bitquery API is responding  
✅ Refresh the page  

### Percentage looks wrong?
✅ Formula is: `100 - (((baseBalance - 206900000) * 100) / 793100000)`  
✅ Check browser console for calculation errors  
✅ Verify `baseBalance` field exists in coin data  

### Colors not showing?
✅ Check that CoinCard.css is loaded  
✅ Clear browser cache  
✅ Verify CSS rules are not overridden
