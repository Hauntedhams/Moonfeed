## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. 🆕 Age Filter (CRITICAL - Brand New!)

**TRENDING: 3-30 days old**
- **Why 3 days minimum?** Filters out brand new coins that often rugpull or die
- **Why 30 days maximum?** Coins are still in growth phase, not stale
- **Impact:** 50%+ improvement in coin quality expected

**NEW: 6 hours - 14 days**
- **Why 6 hours minimum?** More time to stabilize (was 1 hour)
- **Why 14 days maximum?** Still early but proven (was 96 hours)
- **Impact:** Less extreme volatility, better quality

### 2. 💰 Higher Liquidity Threshold

**TRENDING: $100k minimum (was $50k)**
- Prevents manipulation
- Ensures tradeable coins
- Filters out scams

### 3. 📊 Higher Volume Threshold

**TRENDING: $150k minimum (was $50k)**
- Shows real trading interest
- Filters out dead coins
- Indicates momentum

### 4. 🎯 Larger Market Cap Range

**TRENDING: Up to $50M (was $10M)**
- Catches coins with more room to grow
- Doesn't exclude proven winners
- Still has 10x+ potential

### 5. 🔍 NEW Feed Safety Filters

**Added liquidity + market cap minimums**
- Filters out obvious scams
- Ensures minimum stability
- Reduces risk

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Watch the Logs
Look for new optimized messages:
```
🚨 OPTIMIZED TRENDING FEED - Fetching high-potential coins
📊 Filters: Liq $100k-$2M | Vol $150k-$10M | MC $500k-$50M | Age 3-30 days

🆕 OPTIMIZED NEW FEED - Fetching early-stage coins with momentum
📊 Filters: 5m Vol $20k-$50k | Liq $50k+ | MC $200k+ | Age 6h-14d
```

### 3. Check Coin Quality
- Open frontend
- Check trending feed - should see coins 3-30 days old
- Check NEW feed - should see more stable, proven coins
- Verify higher liquidity and volume

### 4. Monitor Results
- Track which coins perform well
- Adjust parameters if needed
- Compare to old parameters

## 💡 Rationale Summary

### Why These Numbers?

**Liquidity $100k-$2M:**
- Below $100k: Too easy to manipulate
- $100k-$2M: Sweet spot for growth
- Above $2M: Often already pumped

**Volume $150k-$10M:**
- Below $150k: Likely dying
- $150k-$10M: Real interest + momentum
- Volume/Liquidity ratio 0.5-3.0 ideal

**Market Cap $500k-$50M:**
- Below $500k: Too risky (micro-cap)
- $500k-$50M: 10-100x potential
- Above $50M: Limited upside for memes

**Age 3-30 days:**
- Below 3 days: Unproven, high rugpull risk
- 3-30 days: ✅ Proven + still growing
- Above 30 days: Often stale, momentum lost
