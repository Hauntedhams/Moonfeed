     - Opens in new tab

**Code Location**: `frontend/src/components/ProfileView.jsx` lines ~1128-1217

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Cancel Handler (Existing)
```javascript
const handleCancelOrder = async (orderId) => {
  // 1. Validates wallet connection
  // 2. Fetches cancel transaction from backend
  // 3. Signs with user's wallet
  // 4. Sends to blockchain
  // 5. Stores cancel signature in localStorage
  // 6. Refreshes order list
}
```

### Jupiter Link Format
```
https://jup.ag/limit/{walletAddress}
```
- Pre-fills user's wallet address
- Shows all their limit orders
- Allows direct cancellation on Jupiter

## 💎 Design Highlights

- **Border**: 2px solid #ff5252
- **Shadow**: Soft red glow
- **Buttons**:
