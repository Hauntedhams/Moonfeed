# Modal Portal Fix - Z-Index Overlay Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Moonfeed Info Modal was not overlaying the feed tabs (New, Trending, DexTrending, Graduating) despite having a very high z-index (99999/100000).

## Root Cause
The modal was being rendered **inside** the `ModernTokenScroller` component, which meant it was subject to that component's stacking context. Even with a high z-index, elements can be trapped within their parent's stacking context and cannot escape to overlay siblings at the root level.

## Solution: React Portal
Used `ReactDOM.createPortal()` to render the modal directly under `document.body`, bypassing any parent stacking contexts.

### Technical Details

**Before:**
```jsx
// Modal rendered inline - trapped in ModernTokenScroller's stacking context
return (
  <div className="moonfeed-info-overlay">
    {/* modal content */}
  </div>
);
```

**After:**
```jsx
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

// Modal rendered at body level - escapes all parent stacking contexts
return createPortal(
  <div className="moonfeed-info-overlay">
    {/* modal content */}
  </div>,
  document.body
);
```

## Why This Works

1. **Stacking Context Independence**: By rendering directly under `<body>`, the modal is no longer constrained by any parent component's stacking context
2. **Z-Index Hierarchy**: The modal's z-index (99999/100000) now correctly positions it above the TopTabs (z-index: 1000) and all other UI elements
3. **DOM Position**: The modal is now a direct child of `<body>`, making it a top-level overlay

## Files Changed

### `/frontend/src/components/MoonfeedInfoModal.jsx`
- Added `import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';`
- Wrapped the modal JSX return in `createPortal(..., document.body)`

## Benefits

✅ **Guaranteed Overlay**: Modal now overlays ALL UI elements, including feed tabs  
✅ **No Z-Index Conflicts**: Portal rendering eliminates stacking context issues  
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Modal is properly isolated from component hierarchy  
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved  

## Testing
After this change, the modal should:
- Open and overlay the feed tabs completely
- Block interaction with tabs while open
- Close smoothly with all animations intact
- Work correctly on all screen sizes

## Z-Index Reference
- TopTabs: `1000`
- MoonfeedInfoButton: `1001`
- Modal Overlay: `99999`
- Modal Container: `100000`

With portal rendering, these values now work as intended across the entire app.
