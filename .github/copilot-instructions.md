This is a modern fullstack meme coin discovery app. The frontend is Vite + React (in /frontend), the backend is Express.js (in /backend). The backend fetches and caches meme coin data from Dexscreener, Pump.fun, and optionally Solana RPC. The frontend uses a TikTok-style vertical scroll interface. Prioritize modular, clean, and maintainable code.
