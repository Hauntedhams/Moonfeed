## Favorites Tab Coin Navigation Enhancement

### Feature Request
Make coins in the favorites tab clickable to load the coin's detail page.

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Already Working
The functionality was already implemented in the codebase:

1. **Click Handler**: `FavoritesGrid` component already had `onCoinClick` prop
2. **Navigation Logic**: `App.jsx` already had `handleCoinClick` function that:
   - Sets the selected coin: `setSelectedCoin(coin)`
   - Navigates to detail view: `setActiveTab('coin-detail')`
3. **Detail View**: App already renders `TokenScroller` with the selected coin
4. **Back Button**: Navigation back to favorites was already implemented

### Improvements Made
Enhanced the user experience with better click handling:

#### 1. **Full Card Clickable Area**
```jsx
<div 
  key={coin.id} 
  className="favorite-card"
  onClick={() => onCoinClick && onCoinClick(coin)}
  style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
  title="Click to view coin details"
>
```
- Made entire favorite card clickable (not just chart area)
- Added visual cursor pointer and tooltip

#### 2. **Better Click Event Handling**
- Removed redundant click handler from chart container
- Maintained `e.stopPropagation()` on remove button and DexScreener header
- Ensured DexScreener header still opens external link without interfering with navigation

#### 3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
```css
.favorite-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
}

.favorite-card:active {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  transition: all 0.1s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```
- Added active state for click feedback
- Maintained existing hover animations

### User Experience Flow

1. **User clicks on any coin card in favorites tab**
2. **App navigates to coin detail view** showing:
   - Full TokenScroller interface focused on that coin
   - Trading capabilities for the selected coin
   - Back button (←) to return to favorites
3. **DexScreener header** (optional): Still opens external DexScreener page in new tab
4. **Remove button** (×): Removes coin from favorites without navigation

### Technical Details

- **Event Propagation**: Properly managed to prevent conflicts between different click areas
- **Navigation State**: Uses existing React state management (`activeTab`, `selectedCoin`)
- **Visual Feedback**: Consistent with app's design system
- **Accessibility**: Added meaningful titles and cursor indicators

### Testing

- ✅ Clicking on favorite cards navigates to coin detail
- ✅ Remove button works without triggering navigation
- ✅ DexScreener header opens external links without interfering
- ✅ Back button returns to favorites view
- ✅ No console errors or build issues
- ✅ Hover and active states provide clear visual feedback

## Result: ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE

Coins in the favorites tab now properly navigate to their detail pages when clicked, providing a seamless user experience for viewing and trading favorite coins.
