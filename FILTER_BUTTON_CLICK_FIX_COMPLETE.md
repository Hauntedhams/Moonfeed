# Filter Button Click Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem
The banner filter button was not clickable because the `.top-tabs-container` had `pointer-events: auto` and was covering the entire top area of the screen, blocking clicks to the filter button.

## Solution
Made the TopTabs container and wrapper pass through clicks (`pointer-events: none`) and only enabled pointer events on the individual tab buttons themselves.

## Changes Made

### 1. TopTabs.css
```css
/* BEFORE */
.top-tabs-container {
  pointer-events: auto; /* Was blocking clicks across entire top area */
}

.top-tabs-wrapper {
  /* No pointer-events specified */
}

.top-tab {
  /* Inherits pointer-events from parent */
}

/* AFTER */
.top-tabs-container {
  pointer-events: none; /* Now passes through clicks */
}

.top-tabs-wrapper {
  pointer-events: none; /* Also passes through clicks */
}

.top-tab {
  pointer-events: auto; /* Only tabs themselves are clickable */
}
```

### 2. ModernTokenScroller.css
```css
/* Increased z-index to be even higher than TopTabs */
.banner-filter-button {
  z-index: 2100; /* Changed from 2001 to 2100 */
  /* Higher than TopTabs (z-index: 1000) */
}
```

## Z-Index Hierarchy (from lowest to highest)
```
1-100:    Coin cards and banner elements
1000:     TopTabs container
2000:     Banner overlay buttons container
2100:     Banner filter button (highest, always clickable)
```

## How It Works Now

1. **TopTabs Container**: Transparent to clicks, only the tab buttons themselves are clickable
2. **Filter Button**: Has highest z-index (2100) and `pointer-events: auto`
3. **Click Area**: TopTabs only blocks clicks in the center (where tabs are), leaving sides open
4. **Filter Button Position**: Top right (20px from top, 20px from right)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] TopTabs container passes through clicks
- [x] Individual tabs are still clickable
- [x] Filter button has higher z-index than TopTabs
- [ ] Filter button is clickable (should work now!)
- [ ] Clicking filter button opens modal
- [ ] Tabs don't interfere with filter button clicks

## Why This Works

The previous issue was that the entire `.top-tabs-container` div was covering the full width of the screen from left to right, and with `pointer-events: auto`, it was capturing all click events in that area - including clicks on the filter button.

By setting `pointer-events: none` on both the container and wrapper, and only enabling it on the individual `.top-tab` elements, we:

1. ✅ Allow clicks to pass through empty areas
2. ✅ Keep tabs clickable (they have `pointer-events: auto`)
3. ✅ Allow filter button clicks to work (no longer blocked)
4. ✅ Maintain all existing tab functionality

The filter button now has:
- **Fixed positioning** at top right
- **Highest z-index** (2100)
- **Explicit pointer-events: auto**
- **No overlapping containers blocking it**
