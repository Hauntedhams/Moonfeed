# 🔄 Render Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub successfully (commit `3f702ce`)
- ⏰ Render is now building and deploying
- 🔍 Need to monitor Render dashboard for deployment status

## What We Just Did

### Commit 1: `a2af708` (Previous)
- Added admin endpoints for monitoring feed refresh status
- Created diagnostic script

### Commit 2: `3f702ce` (Just Now)
- Triggered a redeploy by updating `.deployment-trigger`
- Included additional documentation files
- Total: 13 files changed, 5111 insertions(+)

## How to Check Render Deployment Status

### Option 1: Render Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your backend service
3. Click on "Events" or "Logs" tab
4. Check the latest deployment status

Look for:
- ✅ **"Build succeeded"** - Good!
- ✅ **"Deploy live"** - Excellent!
- ❌ **"Build failed"** - Need to check logs
- ❌ **"Deploy failed"** - Need to check logs

### Option 2: Check if API is Responding
```bash
# Wait 3-5 minutes, then test
curl https://api.moonfeed.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-13T..."}
```

### Option 3: Test New Endpoints
```bash
# Test the new admin endpoints (wait 5 min first)
curl https://api.moonfeed.app/api/admin/trending-refresher-status
curl https://api.moonfeed.app/api/admin/new-refresher-status
```

If you get **404**, deployment hasn't completed yet.
If you get **500**, there's a server error (check Render logs).
If you get **JSON response**, deployment succeeded! 🎉

## Common Render Deployment Failures

### 1. Build Timeout
**Symptom:** "Build exceeded time limit"
**Fix:** Usually retrying works. Render will auto-retry.

### 2. Dependency Install Failures
**Symptom:** "npm install failed" or "Error installing packages"
**Fix:** Check if `package.json` is valid. We already verified it's fine.

### 3. Memory Issues
**Symptom:** "Process ran out of memory"
**Fix:** May need to upgrade Render plan or optimize build.

### 4. Environment Variables Missing
**Symptom:** Server starts but crashes immediately
**Fix:** Check Render dashboard > Environment > ensure all env vars are set:
- `SOLANA_TRACKER_API_KEY`
- `HELIUS_API_KEY`
- Any other required keys

### 5. Port Binding Issues
**Symptom:** "Cannot bind to port"
**Fix:** Server.js already uses `process.env.PORT || 3001` - should be fine.

## What to Do If Deployment Failed

### Step 1: Check Render Logs
```
Dashboard > Your Service > Logs
```

Look for error messages at the end of the log.

### Step 2: Common Fixes

#### If it's a syntax error:
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Desktop/Desktop/moonfeed\ alpha\ copy\ 3/backend
node -c server.js
```
(We already checked this - it's fine)

#### If it's a missing dependency:
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Desktop/Desktop/moonfeed\ alpha\ copy\ 3/backend
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: update package-lock"
git push origin main
```

#### If it's an environment variable issue:
- Go to Render Dashboard
- Navigate to your service
- Click "Environment"
- Verify all required API keys are present

### Step 3: Manual Redeploy
In Render Dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" button
3. Select "Clear build cache & deploy"

## Timeline Expectations

- **Push to GitHub:** ✅ Done (just now)
- **Render detects push:** ~30 seconds
- **Build starts:** ~1 minute
- **Build completes:** ~2-4 minutes
- **Deploy completes:** ~3-5 minutes total

**Check status in 5 minutes from now.**

## Quick Verification Script

After 5 minutes, run this:
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Desktop/Desktop/moonfeed\ alpha\ copy\ 3/backend
node diagnostic-feed-refresh.js
```

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Health check passes
- ✅ Admin endpoints respond (no 404)
- ✅ Both refreshers show "isRunning: true"
- ✅ Feed data is fresh

### If You Still See 404s:
It means the deployment hasn't picked up the new code yet. Options:
1. Wait another 2-3 minutes
2. Check Render dashboard for deployment status
3. Try manual redeploy in Render dashboard

## Emergency Fallback

If deployment keeps failing, we can:
1. Revert to previous working commit
2. Investigate the specific error in Render logs
3. Make a fix and redeploy

To revert (if needed):
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Desktop/Desktop/moonfeed\ alpha\ copy\ 3
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Notes

- The commit method you used before (`git add . && git commit && git push`) is correct
- We used the same method just now
- The difference is we're now adding new API endpoints that need to work
- Previous commits may have been just documentation or minor fixes

## Next Action

**Wait 5 minutes**, then:
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Desktop/Desktop/moonfeed\ alpha\ copy\ 3/backend
node diagnostic-feed-refresh.js
```

This will show if the deployment succeeded and the new endpoints are working.

---

**Time:** Wait until ~5 minutes after push (around 9:35 PM your time)
**Then:** Run diagnostic script
**Expected:** All green checkmarks! ✅
