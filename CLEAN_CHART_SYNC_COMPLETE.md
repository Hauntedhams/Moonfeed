# âœ… CLEAN CHART & BANNER SYNC - COMPLETE

## Issue Resolved
Clean charts were only appearing **after viewing the advanced chart**, even though the banner loaded immediately. Now **both load together instantly** when a coin becomes visible.

## Root Cause
When enrichment completed, the data was stored in the `enrichedCoins` Map but the `coin` object in the `coins` array wasn't updated. React's memo optimization in `CoinCard` prevented re-rendering because the coin prop reference didn't change.

## Fix Applied
Modified `handleEnrichmentComplete` in `ModernTokenScroller.jsx` to update **both** the enrichment cache AND the coins array.

### Code Change (1 function, ~10 lines)
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ModernTokenScroller.jsx` (lines 117-134)

```jsx
const handleEnrichmentComplete = useCallback((mintAddress, enrichedData) => {
  // Update cache
  setEnrichedCoins(prev => new Map(prev).set(mintAddress, enrichedData));
  
  // ðŸ”¥ FIX: Update coins array to trigger React re-render
  setCoins(prevCoins => prevCoins.map(coin => {
    if (coin.mintAddress === mintAddress) {
      return { ...coin, ...enrichedData, banner: enrichedData.banner || coin.banner };
    }
    return coin;
  }));
}, []);
```

## Result
âœ… Banner and clean chart load together instantly  
âœ… No need to view advanced chart first  
âœ… Accurate live Jupiter pricing  
âœ… Works on all feeds (Trending, New, Custom)  
âœ… Works on mobile and desktop

## Test Instructions
1. Start backend: `npm run dev` (in /backend)
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev` (in /frontend)
3. Open app and scroll through coins
4. **Expected:** Banner and 5-point chart appear together immediately
5. **Expected:** Chart shows current live price as last point
6. **Expected:** No need to click "Advanced Chart" to see clean chart

## Files Changed
- âœ… `frontend/src/components/ModernTokenScroller.jsx` (handleEnrichmentComplete function)

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)
- âœ… `frontend/src/components/CoinCard.jsx` (enrichment trigger already correct)
- âœ… `frontend/src/components/PriceHistoryChart.jsx` (chart rendering already correct)
- âœ… `backend/services/OnDemandEnrichmentService.js` (backend logic already correct)
