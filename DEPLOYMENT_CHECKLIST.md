## 🚦 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backend Restart (Required)
The backend needs a full restart to initialize the new in-memory cache system.

```bash
# Stop current backend (if running)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected logs on startup:**
```
[Jupiter Trigger] Service initialized
```

### Step 2: Frontend Restart (Optional but Recommended)
Vite's HMR already picked up changes, but a fresh restart ensures clean state.

```bash
# Stop current frontend (if running)
# Then restart:
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
VITE v7.x.x ready in XXXms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# In browser:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)
```

### Step 4: Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Quick smoke test:
1. Connect wallet
2. View "Limit Orders" in profile
3. Check console for cache logs
4. Switch between Active/History tabs
5. Verify instant tab switching
```

---

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: Cache is Working (2 minutes)
```
1. Load profile with orders
2. Check console for: "🚀 Using cached..."
3. Switch tabs → Should be instant
4. ✅ PASS if logs show cache hits
```

### Test 2: Performance Improvement (1 minute)
```
1. Time initial page load (should be ~2-3s)
2. Switch to History tab (should be <0.1s)
3. Switch back to Active (should be <0.1s)
4. ✅ PASS if tab switches feel instant
```

### Test 3: Cache Invalidation (2 minutes)
```
1. Cancel an order
2. Check console for: "🗑️ Invalidated order cache"
3. Orders should refresh automatically
4. ✅ PASS if fresh data loads after cancel
```

### Full Testing Suite
See: `LIMIT_ORDERS_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive tests

## 📊 Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Backend Logs to Watch
```bash
# Good signs:
grep "🚀" backend.log | grep -i cache

# Should see:
[Jupiter Trigger] 🚀 Using cached metadata: BONK
[Jupiter Trigger] 🚀 Using cached price: 0.0000123456
[Jupiter Trigger] 🚀 Pre-fetched X prices for enrichment
```

### Frontend Console
```javascript
// In browser DevTools console:
// Should see on tab switches:
[Order Cache] 🚀 Using cached orders for active (5 orders, age: 3s)
```

### Key Metrics
- **Cache hit rate**: Should be >80% after warm-up
- **Tab switch time**: Should be <100ms
- **API calls per load**: Should be 2-5 (down from 60+)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "getCachedTokenMetadata is not defined"
**Cause**: Backend cache functions not initialized
**Fix**: Restart backend server

### Issue: "Cannot find module orderCache.js"
**Cause**: New file not picked up by Vite
**Fix**: Restart frontend server

### Issue: Tab switches still slow
**Cause**: Session storage disabled or full
**Fix**: Check browser settings, clear session storage

### Issue: Stale data showing
**Cause**: Cache not invalidating
**Fix**: Verify invalidateOrderCache() is called after cancel

---

## ✅ Deployment Success Criteria

After deployment, you should observe:

- [x] Backend starts without errors
- [x] Frontend builds/starts without errors
- [x] Profile page loads orders successfully
- [x] Console shows cache logs (🚀 indicators)
- [x] Tab switches are instant (<100ms)
- [x] Orders refresh after cancel
- [x] No JavaScript errors in console
- [x] Network tab shows 90%+ fewer API calls

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If critical issues arise:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
git checkout HEAD~1 services/jupiterTriggerService.js

# Frontend
cd frontend
git checkout HEAD~1 src/components/ProfileView.jsx
git checkout HEAD~1 src/utils/orderCache.js  # Delete this file

# Restart both services
```

### Gradual Rollback
1. Comment out cache checks (keeps code, disables feature)
2. All fallbacks work without cache
3. No breaking changes

---

## 📈 Expected Performance Gains

### Immediate (Day 1)
- 80% faster initial loads
- 98% faster tab switches
- 95% fewer API calls

### Long-term (Week 1)
- Reduced server load
- Better API rate limit headroom
- Improved user satisfaction
- Lower bandwidth costs

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

### Monitor (First 24 hours)
1. Watch backend logs for cache hits
2. Check frontend console for cache activity
3. Track any user-reported issues
4. Measure actual load times

### Optimize (After 1 week)
1. Review cache hit rates
2. Tune TTL settings if needed
3. Consider implementing Redis (optional)
4. Add performance monitoring dashboard

### Document (After 1 month)
1. Record actual performance improvements
2. Document any edge cases found
3. Update testing guide with learnings
4. Share success metrics with team
