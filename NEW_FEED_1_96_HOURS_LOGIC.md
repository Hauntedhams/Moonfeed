# NEW Feed - 1 to 96 Hours Old Logic ‚úÖ

## Time Range Logic

Based on the image you provided, the NEW feed uses this exact logic:

```javascript
const now = Date.now();
const minCreatedAt = now - (96 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 96 hours ago (oldest)
const maxCreatedAt = now - (1 * 60 * 60 * 1000);  // 1 hour ago (youngest)
```

### Why This Range?

**`minCreatedAt` ‚Üí now - 96 hours (oldest you'll allow)**
- Coins older than 96 hours (4 days) are excluded
- This keeps the feed fresh with recent launches

**`maxCreatedAt` ‚Üí now - 1 hour (youngest you'll allow)**
- Coins newer than 1 hour are excluded
- **Gives them time to stabilize** before appearing
- Avoids showing coins with no trading history

### Result: Coins Between 1-96 Hours Old

‚úÖ Perfect for "new but trending upward" tab  
‚úÖ Coins have had time to establish some trading activity  
‚úÖ Not too new (unstable) or too old (established)

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **UPDATED:** `fetchNewCoinBatch()` in `server.js`
- Now uses `minCreatedAt: now - 96 hours`
- Now uses `maxCreatedAt: now - 1 hour`
- Properly filters for 1-96 hour old coins

‚úÖ **UPDATED:** `test-new-feed-api.js`
- Test script matches the new logic
- Will show coins between 1-96 hours old

---

## Testing

Run the test to see actual coins:

```bash
node test-new-feed-api.js
```

Expected output:
```
üéØ TOP 10 NEW COINS (1-96 hours old, $15k-$30k 5m volume)

1. COIN1 - Created 2h ago, $18k 5m volume
2. COIN2 - Created 12h ago, $22k 5m volume
3. COIN3 - Created 24h ago, $25k 5m volume
...
```

All coins will be between 1 and 96 hours old! ‚úÖ
