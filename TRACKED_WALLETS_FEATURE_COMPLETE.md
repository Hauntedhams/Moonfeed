# Tracked Wallets Feature - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive "Track Wallet" feature that allows users to save and monitor wallets of interest. Tracked wallets are displayed in the Profile section with full analytics access.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Context Management
**File:** `/frontend/src/contexts/TrackedWalletsContext.jsx`
- Created React Context for managing tracked wallets
- LocalStorage persistence for data retention across sessions
- Provides methods: `trackWallet()`, `untrackWallet()`, `isTracked()`, `updateWalletLabel()`, `updateLastViewed()`
- Automatically loads tracked wallets on app mount
- Stores wallet data with: address, label, addedAt timestamp, lastViewed timestamp

### 2. WalletPopup Integration
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/WalletPopup.jsx`
- Added "Track Wallet" button in the popup header
- Button shows current tracking state: "‚òÜ Track" or "‚≠ê Tracked"
- Toggle functionality to track/untrack wallets
- Uses `useTrackedWallets` hook to access context
- Only shows button when data is loaded successfully

**CSS:** `/frontend/src/components/WalletPopup.css`
- Styled track button with indigo theme
- Untracked state: Bordered button with transparent background
- Tracked state: Filled button with solid indigo background
- Hover effects and subtle animations
- All text forced to proper colors for readability

### 3. ProfileView Display
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/ProfileView.jsx`
- New "Tracked Wallets" section in profile view
- Shows count of tracked wallets in section header
- Empty state with helpful hint text
- Each tracked wallet displays:
  - Wallet icon and shortened address
  - Custom label (or default "Wallet N")
  - Date added
  - Two action buttons: View Analytics (üìä) and Untrack (‚úï)
- Clicking wallet address or view button opens WalletPopup
- WalletPopup properly rendered and can be closed

**CSS:** `/frontend/src/components/ProfileView.css`
- New styles for tracked wallets section
- Card-based layout with hover effects
- Clean action buttons with icon indicators
- Responsive design maintains on mobile
- Consistent with existing profile sections styling

### 4. App Integration
**File:** `/frontend/src/App.jsx`
- App wrapped with `TrackedWalletsProvider`
- Context available throughout the entire application
- No performance impact

## User Flow

### Tracking a Wallet:
1. Click on any wallet address (in CoinCard, TopTradersList, etc.)
2. WalletPopup opens with wallet analytics
3. Click "‚òÜ Track" button in popup header
4. Button changes to "‚≠ê Tracked"
5. Wallet is saved to localStorage
6. Success feedback (console log)

### Viewing Tracked Wallets:

2. Scroll to "Tracked Wallets" section
3. See all tracked wallets with metadata
4. Click wallet address or üìä button to view analytics

## Features

### Data Persistence
- All tracked wallets saved to localStorage
- Key: `moonfeed_tracked_wallets`
- Survives browser refresh and app restart
- No backend/database required

### Wallet Information Stored
```javascript
{
  address: "wallet_address_here",
  label: "Wallet 1" or custom label,
  addedAt: 1234567890, // timestamp
  lastViewed: 1234567890 // timestamp (future use)
}
```

### Smart Detection
- Prevents duplicate tracking (address-based check)
- Shows correct state in WalletPopup when reopening tracked wallet
- Instant UI updates when tracking/untracking

### Empty States
- Profile shows helpful message when no wallets tracked
- "Click 'Track' on any wallet to add it here"

## Visual Design

### Track Button (WalletPopup)

- **Tracked:** Filled indigo button with ‚≠ê icon
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Tracked Wallets List (Profile)
- Dark card background with subtle borders
- Hover effect: Blue glow and slight lift
- Clean two-column layout (info left, actions right)
- Monospace font for wallet addresses
- Icon-based action buttons (üìä View, ‚úï Remove)

### Colors & Theme
- **Primary:** Indigo (#4F46E5) for track button
- **Success:** Blue (#4FC3F7) for view action
- **Danger:** Red (#ef4444) for remove action
- **Background:** Dark cards with transparency
- **Text:** White for primary, gray for metadata

## Technical Details
