# Orders Page Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully created a dedicated Orders page for viewing and managing active Jupiter limit orders. This separates the orders functionality from the Profile page, providing a cleaner and more focused user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `/frontend/src/components/OrdersView.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page for managing limit orders
- **Features**:
  - Fetches and displays active and historical Jupiter limit orders
  - Order status filtering (Active/History tabs)
  - Detailed order information including:
    - Current price vs trigger price with live updates
    - Amount, created time, expiration countdown
    - Estimated value in SOL
    - Transaction signatures with Solscan links
  - Expired order warnings with prominent "CANCEL & RETRIEVE FUNDS" actions
  - Escrow information badges explaining where funds are held
  - Jupiter integration for manual cancellation
  - Order cancellation functionality
  - Wallet connection prompt when not connected
  
#### `/frontend/src/components/OrdersView.css`
- **Purpose**: Styling for the OrdersView component
- **Highlights**:
  - iOS-style design consistent with the app
  - Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
  - Color-coded order types (buy/sell)
  - Status badges (active, executed, cancelled)
  - Animated loading spinners
  - Pulse animations for urgent expired orders
  - Gradient backgrounds for warnings and badges
  - Clean card-based layout with proper spacing

### 2. Modified Files

#### `/frontend/src/App.jsx`
- **Added**: Import for `OrdersView` component
- **Updated**: `handleOrdersClick()` to navigate to the new 'orders' tab
- **Updated**: Top tabs conditional rendering to exclude 'orders' from showing tabs
- **Updated**: Main content routing to include orders view:
  ```jsx
  ) : activeTab === 'orders' ? (
    <OrdersView />
  ) : activeTab === 'coin-detail' && selectedCoin ? (
  ```

#### `/frontend/src/components/BottomNavBar.jsx`
- **Already configured**: Orders button with clipboard/list icon and "Orders" label
- **Properly highlights**: When `activeTab === 'orders'`
- **Calls**: `onOrdersClick` prop when clicked

## User Flow

### Before
1. User clicks "Orders" in bottom nav
2. Navigates to Profile page
3. Must scroll past profile info to find limit orders section
4. Orders mixed with other profile features

### After
1. User clicks "Orders" in bottom nav
2. Navigates directly to dedicated Orders page
3. Immediately sees all active and historical orders
4. Clean, focused interface specifically for order management

## Key Features

### Active Orders Display
- **Live price tracking**: Shows current price vs trigger price
- **Visual progress indicators**: Price comparison with arrows
- **Expiration countdown**: Real-time countdown to order expiry
- **Escrow information**: Clear badges explaining fund custody
- **Cancel functionality**: One-click order cancellation with wallet signature

### Expired Orders Warning
- **Prominent alerts**: Red gradient warning boxes for expired orders

### Order History
- **Status tracking**: Executed and cancelled orders

- **Simplified view**: Clean layout showing essential info

### Wallet Integration
- **Connection prompt**: Clear call-to-action when wallet not connected
- **Automatic updates**: Orders refresh when wallet connects/disconnects
- **Caching**: Smart caching reduces API calls

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses `useState` for local state (orders, loading, errors)
- Implements `useEffect` for wallet connection and filter changes
- Integrates with existing order cache system

### API Integration
- Fetches orders from backend: `/api/trigger/orders`
- Cancels orders via: `/api/trigger/cancel-order`
- Executes transactions via: `/api/trigger/execute`

### Transaction Handling
- Supports both versioned (v0) and legacy transactions
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fallback to Jupiter interface for manual cancellation
- Stores transaction signatures in localStorage

### Styling
- Uses CSS variables for theming (dark/light mode support)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent with app's design language

## Navigation Structure

```
Bottom Nav Bar
