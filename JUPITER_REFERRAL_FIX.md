# üí∞ Jupiter Referral Configuration Fix

## Issue
Jupiter referral fees were not going to the correct wallet. The backend was configured with:
- **Wrong wallet**: `FxWWHg9LPWiH9ixwv5CWq6eepTg1A6EYEpMzXC6s98xD`
- **Wrong fee**: 70 BPS (0.7%)

## Solution
Updated backend environment variables to use the correct configuration:
- **Correct wallet**: `42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt`
- **Correct fee**: 100 BPS (1.0%)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. `/backend/.env`
```bash
# Before
JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT=FxWWHg9LPWiH9ixwv5CWq6eepTg1A6EYEpMzXC6s98xD
JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS=70

# After
JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT=42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt
JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS=100
```

### 2. `/backend/.env.example`
Added Jupiter referral configuration documentation:
```bash
# Jupiter Referral Configuration (for limit orders)
JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT=42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt
JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS=100
```

---

## How It Works

The Jupiter Trigger Service (`/backend/services/jupiterTriggerService.js`) reads these environment variables and includes them in every limit order creation:

```javascript
// Lines 74-75
const REFERRAL_ACCOUNT = process.env.JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT;
const FEE_BPS = parseInt(process.env.JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS) || 70;

// Lines 122-126 - Applied to every order
if (REFERRAL_ACCOUNT) {
  payload.referralAccount = REFERRAL_ACCOUNT;
  payload.feeBps = FEE_BPS;
  console.log(`[Jupiter Trigger] Using referral account: ${REFERRAL_ACCOUNT} with ${FEE_BPS} BPS`);
}
```

---

## What This Means

### For Users
- **No change** - Users still get the same Jupiter limit order experience
- Orders execute at the same prices
- No additional fees visible to users (Jupiter absorbs the referral fee)

### For You
- **100 BPS (1%) referral fee** on every limit order executed through your app
- Fee goes to wallet: `42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt`
- Automatically collected when orders execute
- No additional integration needed

---

## Fee Examples

| Order Value | 100 BPS Fee (1%) | Your Revenue |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| $100        | $1.00            | $1.00        |
| $1,000      | $10.00           | $10.00       |
| $10,000     | $100.00          | $100.00      |
| $100,000    | $1,000.00        | $1,000.00    |

**Note**: Fees are collected in the token being traded, automatically sent to your referral wallet when the order executes.

---

## Verification

To verify the configuration is active:

1. **Check backend logs** when creating a limit order:
   ```
   [Jupiter Trigger] Using referral account: 42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt with 100 BPS
   ```

2. **Check order payload** in the logs:
   ```json
   {
     "maker": "user_wallet",
     "inputMint": "...",
     "outputMint": "...",
     "referralAccount": "42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt",
     "feeBps": 100
   }
   ```

3. **Check your wallet** after orders execute - you should see small amounts of tokens arriving from executed orders

---

## Testing

To test that the configuration is working:

1. **Backend is running** with new config ‚úÖ
2. **Create a limit order** through the app
3. **Check logs** for referral account confirmation
4. **Wait for order to execute**
5. **Check wallet** `42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt` for fee collection

---

## Important Notes

### Fee Collection Timing
- Fees are only collected **when the order executes**
- If an order is cancelled before execution, no fee is collected
- Fees are in the **output token** (what the user is buying)

### Fee Visibility
- Users do **not** see the referral fee as a separate line item
- Jupiter includes it in the execution price
- Your fee is transparent to users (part of Jupiter's built-in referral system)

### Production Deployment
- ‚úÖ Backend `.env` updated
- ‚úÖ Backend restarted with new config
- ‚úÖ Configuration will persist across restarts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to deploy these `.env` changes to production server

---

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/.env` - Updated referral wallet and fee
2. `/backend/.env.example` - Added referral configuration documentation

---

## Deployment Checklist

For production deployment:

- [ ] Update production `.env` file with correct referral wallet
- [ ] Set `JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS=100`
- [ ] Restart production backend
- [ ] Verify logs show correct referral account
- [ ] Test a limit order to confirm configuration works
- [ ] Monitor referral wallet for incoming fees

---

## ‚úÖ Status: FIXED

The Jupiter referral configuration has been updated. All future limit orders will include the correct referral account and 100 BPS (1%) fee.

**Backend restarted with new configuration.** ‚úÖ

---

## Revenue Tracking

To track your referral revenue:

1. **Monitor wallet**: `42DqmQMZrVeZkP2Btj2cS96Ej81jVxFqwUZWazVvhUPt`
2. **Watch for incoming transactions** from executed orders
3. **Jupiter Dashboard** (if available): Check Jupiter's referral dashboard for statistics
4. **Backend logs**: Each order creation logs the referral configuration

---

## Questions?

- **Where do fees come from?** Jupiter's protocol fees (users don't pay extra)
- **When are fees paid?** When limit orders execute on-chain
- **What token are fees in?** The output token of the swap
- **Can users see the fee?** No, it's built into Jupiter's execution price

**Your referral wallet is now correctly configured to receive 1% of all limit order volume! üéâ**
